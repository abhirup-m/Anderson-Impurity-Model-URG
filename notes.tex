\section{Preliminaries}
\subsection{\il{T-}matrix and \il{S-}matrix}
\il{T-}matrix is defined as
\beq
V\psi = T\phi
\eeq
where \il{\psi} is the total scattered wavefunction and \il{\phi} is the incoming wavefunction.
They satisfy the Schrodinger equations
\begin{gather}
H_0 \phi = E \phi\\
(H_0 + V)\psi = E \psi
\end{gather}
Since we are assuming elastic scattering, both have the same energy.
The Schrodinger equation for \il{\psi} can be rearranged into
\beq[lse]
\psi = \phi + G_0V\psi
\eeq
where \il{G_0^{-1} = E - H_0}.
This is also called the Lippmann-Schwinger equation.
Using the definition of \il{T} gives
\beq
\psi &= \phi + G_0 T \phi \\
\implies \psi &=(1+G_0T) \phi
\eeq
Eq.~\ref{lse} can also be written as 
\beq
\psi = (1- G_0V)^{-1} \phi
\eeq
Comparing the last two equations gives
\beq
1 &= (1-G_0 V)(1+G_0 T) \\
\implies T &= V +VG_0 T
\eeq
The last equation allows us to perturbatively expand the \il{T-} matrix.
\beq
T = V + VG_0V + VG_0VG_0V + ...
\eeq
From scattering theory, we can write
\beq
\psi = \rr{2\pi}^{-\fr{3}{2}}\qq{e^{ikx} + f \fr{e^{ikr}}{r}}
\eeq
where the wave amplitude \il{f(k^\prime,k) \sim \bra{k^\prime} V \ket{\psi}}.
Using the definition of \il{T}, we get
\beq
f(k^\prime,k) \sim \bra{k^\prime} T \ket{k}
\eeq
By definition, the \il{S-}matrix is
\beq
S(\omega) = e^{2i\pi\delta(\omega)} 
\eeq
Also,
\beq
S = 1-2 i \pi \rho T
\eeq
Therefore,
\beq[tmatphase]
T = \fr{1}{2i\pi \rho}\rr{1 - e^{2i\pi\delta(\omega)}} = -\fr{e^{i\delta}\sin \delta}{\pi \rho}
\eeq

\subsection{An identity}
If, for some operator \il{A}, we have \il{\qq{H,A} = \lambda A}, where \il{\lambda} is some scalar, then we can write
\beq
HA = A(\lambda+H)
\eeq
A consequence of this is, for another scalar E, we can write
\begin{gather}
(E - H)A = AE - A(\lambda+H) = A\rr{E -\lambda -H} \\
\implies A(E - \lambda - H)^{-1} = (E-H)^{-1}A\label{identity}
\end{gather}

\subsection{Landau's theory of Fermi liquid}
A ideal Fermi gas is a collection of non-interacting Fermions.
Since they are non-interacting, the eigenstates of the complete system are just the collections of the eigenstates of the particles and holes.
The eigenstate will be of  the form \il{\{n_{k_1\ua},n_{k_1\da},n_{k_2\ua},n_{k_2\da},n_{k_3\ua},n_{k_3\da},...,\}}, where \il{n_{k\sigma}\in\{0,1\}} is the number of particles with momentum \il{k} and spin \il{\sigma}.
In the ground state,
\beq
n_{k\sigma} = \begin{cases} 1 & k \leq k_F \\ 0 & k>k_F \end{cases} 
\eeq
Excitations involve adding an electron above \il{k_F} or deleting an electron below \il{k_F}.
The former is called a \it{particle} while the latter is called a \it{hole}.
\bf{A general excited state of the total system is a collection of particle and hole excitations.}\\\\
We next consider interacting systems, but very specific ones.
That is, we consider interacting systems whose excitations can be mapped one-to-one with the excitations of the ideal system, provided the interactions are turned on sufficiently slowly.
Alternatively, there exists a sufficiently slow rate of turning off the interactions such that any interacting excited state \il{\Psi^*} continuously flows into some excited state \il{\Phi} of the ideal system as the interactions flow to 0.
\begin{gather}
\Psi^* \xrightarrow{\text{turn interactions off}} \Phi \\
\Phi^* \xrightarrow{\text{turn interactions off}} \Psi
\end{gather}
If some state \il{\Gamma^*}, instead of flowing into an ideal excited state, gets lost while the interactions are being turned off, then we arent considering that system.
All excited states must flow into some ideal state and vice-versa.
This means that the interacting excited states can be labelled by the same good quantum numbers \il{\vec k} and \il{\sigma}.That is, if some eigenstate of the interacting system flows into the ideal eigenstate \il{\{n_{k\sigma}\}}, we can just as well use the distribution \il{\{n_{k\sigma}\}} to label the interacting eigenstate.
\textit{The particle and hole excitations of the ideal system might flow into some very complicated state of the interacting system, which we call a quasiparticle/quasihole}.
In other words, a system (ideal ground state + particle of momentum \il{k}) goes to (interacting ground state + quasip of momentum \il{k}).
If an interacting eigenstate corresponds to the state \il{\{n_{k\sigma}\}}, then \il{\{n_{k\sigma}\}} is said to be the quasiparticle distribution function for that interacting state.
Just as we denote eigenstates of the total ideal system using the collection of particles and holes, similarly we use the quasiparticle and quasiholes to describe eigenstates of the interacting system.
Let \il{k_+>k_F} and \il{k_- < k_F}.
Then,
\begin{gather}
	\ket{IGS}\otimes\ket{k_+} \xrightarrow{\text{turn interactions on}} \ket{RGS}\otimes\ket{k_+}^* \\
	\ket{IGS}\otimes\ket{k_-} \xrightarrow{\text{turn interactions on}} \ket{RGS}\otimes\ket{k_-}^* \\
\end{gather}
\il{\ket{}^*} denotes a quasiket.
IGS and RGS are ideal and real(interacting) ground states.
Another way of putting this is
\begin{gather}
c^\dagger_{k_+}\ket{IGS} \xrightarrow{\text{turn interactions on}} \eta^\dagger_{k_+}\ket{RGS}\\
c_{k_-}\ket{IGS} \xrightarrow{\text{turn interactions on}} \eta_{k_-}\ket{RGS}
\end{gather}
\il{\eta^\dagger} is the creation operator for the quasiparticle.
\il{n_k} gives the distribution of momentum \il{k} quasiparticles.
If \il{n^0_k} is the distribution in the ground state, the excitation can be measured as 
\beq
\delta n_k = n_k - n^0_k
\eeq
In general, the total energy \il{\mathcal{E}} of the system will be a functional of the distribution function \il{n_k}.
For the ideal system, this function is very simple.
\beq
\mathcal{E}^0[n_k] = \sum_k n_k \epsilon_k
\eeq
The functional in case of the interacting system might be very complex.
Upto first order in the functional, we can write
\beq
\mathcal{E}[n_k] = \mathcal{E}[n^0_k] + \sum_k \pd{\mathcal{E}}{n_k}\delta n_k
\eeq
The first order variation in \il{\mathcal{E}} is thus
\beq[tote]
\delta \mathcal{E} \equiv \mathcal{E}[n_k] -\mathcal{E}[n^0_k] = \sum_k \xi_k \delta n_k
\eeq
where \il{\xi_k = \pd{\mathcal{E}}{n_k}}.
\il{\xi_k} is the energy of the quasiparticles(hole) or momentum \il{k}.
To see this, note that if \il{\mathcal{E}[n_k^1]} and \il{\mathcal{E}[n_k^2]} are the energies before and after adding a quasiparticle of momentum \il{q}, we have
\beq
n_k^2 - n_k^1 = \begin{cases} 0 & k \neq q\\ 1 & k = q \end{cases}
\eeq
Then, up to first order,
\beq
\mathcal{E}[n_k^2] - \mathcal{E}[n_k^1] = \sum_k \xi_k \rr{n^2_k - n^1_k} = \xi_q
\eeq
This shows that the effect of adding a quasiparticle of momentum \il{q} is to raise the total energy by \il{\xi_q}.
It is thus sensible to call that the energy of the quasiparticle.
\il{\xi_k} itself might depend on whether other quasiparticles are present; there might be interactions among them.
This effectively means that \il{xi_k} itself is, in general, a functional of \il{n_k}.
Consequently, we expand it upto first order.
\beq[quasienergy]
\xi_k = \xi_k^0 + \sum_q \pd{\xi_k}{n_q} \delta n_q
\eeq
Eq.~\ref{tote} then becomes
\beq
\delta\mathcal{E} = \sum_k \xi^0_k \delta n_k + \sum_{k,q} f(k,q) \delta n_k \delta n_q
\eeq
where \il{f(k,q) = \pd{\xi_k}{n_q} = \fr{\partial^2 \mathcal{E}}{\partial n_k \partial n_q}} is the interaction between two quasiparticles of momenta \il{k} and \il{q}.
The first term is the self energy of the quasiparticles, the other they would have had even if no other quasiparticle was present.
Its sort of like their kinetic energy.
The second term is the interaction energy between all the quasiparticles.
Hence, the term \il{f(k_1,k_2)} comes into play only when \il{\delta n_{k_1} \neq 0} and \il{\delta n_{k_2} \neq 0}, that is when both the quasiparticles are present.\\\\
Since the quasiparticles are in direct correspondence with the fermionic particles, they must also be fermions.
This allows us to write down the probability of finding a quasiparticle at energy \il{\xi},
\beq
f(\xi) = \qq{e^{(\xi - \mu)\beta} + 1}^{-1}
\eeq
where \il{\mu = \mathcal{E_0}(N+1) - \mathcal{E_0}(N)= \pd{\mathcal{E}_0}{N}} is the change in ground state energy on adding one quasiparticle.
There is a subtlety here though.
Since \il{\xi} itself depends on the occupancy, and the occupancy also depends on \il{\xi} through the probability distribution, there is a feedback effect in action here.
If any perturbation or field modifies the occupation \il{n_{k\sigma}}, it will produce a feedback effect on all the occupations, through the \il{\xi}.
\\\\
A temperature-dependent free energy can be concocted using
\beq
F[\delta n_k] = \delta \mathcal{E}[\delta n_k] - T S[\delta n_k]
\eeq
Minimizing this gives an expectation value of the excitation distribution \il{\avg{\delta n_k}}.
This in turn gives a temperature-dependent quasiparticle energy
\beq[temp_en]
\xi_k(T) = \xi^0_k + \sum_{q} f(k,q)\avg{\delta n_q}
\eeq
where \il{\avg{\delta n_q}} is obtained by
\beq
\dv{F}{\delta n_q}\bigg|_{\delta n_q = \avg{\delta n_q}} = 0
\eeq
\subsection{The model}
\beq
H = \epsilon_d \hat n_d + \sum_{k} \epsilon_k \hat n_k + \sum_{k\sigma}t\rr{c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c_{d\sigma}+c^\dagger_{d\sigma}c_{k\sigma}} + U\hat n_{d\ua}\hat n_{d\da}
\eeq
\paragraph{Energy scales:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \il{\epsilon_d}
	\item \il{U}
	\item \il{\fr{2\Delta}{\hbar} = \tau^{-1} = \fr{2\pi}{\hbar}t^2\sum_k \rho(\epsilon_k) \ra } extent of hybridisation (rate of transition) between conduction band and impurity site
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Situations:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \il{U \gg \epsilon_d \gg \Delta}: Double occupation is not possible.
\il{\Delta} being small means very small hybridisation.
So, d-site is either up or down, hence magnetic.
	\item \il{U \gg \Delta\gg \epsilon_d }: Double occupation is still not possible, but now hybridisation will allows the up and down spins to fluctuate on the d-site, leading to zero average magnetization.
	\item \il{\Delta\gg U \gg \epsilon_d}: Hybridisation now fluctuates the up and down spins , leading to zero average magnetization.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Atomic limit (\il{t=0})}
\beq
H_\text{atomic} = E_d + E_{CB} + U n_{d\ua}n_{d\da}
\eeq
Since we are not interested in the Fermi sea, the \il{E_{CB}} is dropped:
\beq
H_\text{atomic} = \epsilon_d n_d + U n_{d\ua}n_{d\da}
\eeq
For a magnetic solution, we need
\beq
(\epsilon_\ua = \epsilon_\da =)\epsilon_d < (\epsilon_0,\epsilon_{\ua\da}) 0,2\epsilon_d + U
\eeq
Assuming \il{\epsilon_d = -|\epsilon_d|}, this is equivalent to
\beq
\epsilon_d > -U
\eeq

\subsection{Non-interacting limit (\il{U=0}):}
\beq
H_\text{non-int} = \epsilon_d n_d + \sum_k \epsilon_k n_k + \sum_{k\sigma} t\rr{c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c_{d\sigma}+c^\dagger_{d\sigma}c_{k\sigma}}
\eeq
\subsubsection{Green's function of impurity site:}
We want to write down the \it{Green's function} \il{G_d} for the impurity site.
In the absence of the hybridisation, this quantity is
\beq
G^0_d(E) = \fr{1}{E - \epsilon_d}
\eeq
In the presence of the coupling with the conduction band, there are several ways of creating an excitation at the impurity site, with an energy \il{E}.
The first is the bare Green's function.
This is the situation when the impurity site electron has not scattered.
Next is the case that there is an excitation with energy E (\il{G^0_d(E)}) followed by a scattering to the conduction band at some momentum \il{k}.
The probability of the scattering is \il{t}.
The Greens function for creating the electron \il{k} is \il{G^0_k = \fr{1}{E-\epsilon_k}}, and the probability of again scattering back to the impurity site is \il{t}, with the Greens function for this final excitation being \il{G^0_d}.
The total Greens function contribution for this case is
\beq
G^0_d \Sigma_c G^0_d, \text{  where  }\Sigma_c = t \rr{\sum_k G^0_k} t = \sum_k \fr{t^2}{E - \epsilon_k}
\eeq
Considering higher scatterings lead to terms like \il{G^0_d \Sigma_c G^0_d\Sigma_c G^0_d},\\\il{G^0_d \Sigma_c G^0_d\Sigma_c G^0_d\Sigma_c G^0_d} and so on.
The total Greens function is
\beq
G_d(E) &= G^0_d + G^0_d \Sigma_c G^0_d + G^0_d \Sigma_c G^0_d\Sigma_c G^0_d + G^0_d \Sigma_c G^0_d\Sigma_c G^0_d\Sigma_c G^0_d + ...
\\
       &= G^0_d\qq{1+\rr{\Sigma_c G^0_d}^2+...} = G^0_d \fr{1}{1-\Sigma_c G^0_d} = \fr{1}{E - \epsilon_d - \Sigma_c(E)} 
\eeq
Now,
\begin{gather}
\fr{1}{t^2}\Sigma_c(E) = \sum_k \fr{1}{E - \epsilon_k} = \lim_{\eta \ra 0}\int_{-W}^W d\epsilon \rho(\epsilon) \fr{1}{E - \epsilon + i\eta}\\
\implies \fr{1}{t^2}\text{Re} \qq{\Sigma_c(E)} = \int_{-W}^W d\epsilon \rho(\epsilon)\fr{1}{E - \epsilon}, \text{and }\\
\fr{1}{t^2}\text{Im} \qq{\Sigma_c(E)} = \int_{-W}^W d\epsilon \rho(\epsilon) (-i\pi)\delta(E-\epsilon)
\end{gather}
Assuming \il{\rho(E)} varies sufficiently slowly, we can neglect the real part,
\beq
\Sigma_c(E) = \text{Im}\qq{\Sigma_c(E)} = -i\pi t^2 \rho(E) = -i\Delta
\eeq
Therefore,
\beq
G_d(E) = \fr{1}{E-\epsilon_d+i\Delta}
\eeq
The difference from \il{G^0_f} can be seen by computing the density of states for both the bare and the interacting ones:
\begin{gather}
	\rho_d^0(E) = -\fr{1}{\pi}\text{Im}\qq{G^0_f} = -\fr{1}{\pi} \lim_{\eta \ra 0} \fr{1}{E - \epsilon_d + i\eta} = \delta(E - \epsilon_d)\\
	\rho_d(E) = -\fr{1}{\pi}\text{Im}\qq{G_f}= -\fr{1}{\pi} \lim_{\eta \ra 0} \fr{1}{E - \epsilon_d + i(\eta+\Delta)} = \fr{1}{\pi}\fr{\Delta}{(E-\epsilon_d)^2 + \Delta^2}\label{densitys}
\end{gather}
The first density of states is delta function, because \il{\epsilon_d} is an eigenstate in that case, and the poles of the corresponding Green's function are real poles.
But the presence of the hybridisation means that is no longer the case in the second density of states, so the delta function fades into a Lorentzian in that case, and the poles of the Greens function move off the real axis.

The total number of d-electrons can be calculated as:
\beq[total]
\avg{n_d} = 2\int d\epsilon \rho_d(\epsilon) = \fr{2\Delta}{\pi} \int \fr{d\epsilon}{(\epsilon-\epsilon_d)^2 + \Delta^2} = \fr{2}{\pi}\cot^{-1}\rr{\fr{\epsilon_d}{\Delta}}
\eeq
\subsubsection{Phase shift of conduction electron due to scattering off the impurity:}
\il{T-}matrix is defined by
\beq
T = V + VGT 
\eeq
We also have
\beq
G = G_0 + G_0VG &= G_0 + G_0 T \fr{1}{1+GT}G \\
		&= G_0 + G_0T(1-GT+...)(G_0+G_0VG_0+...)\\
		&= G_0 + G_0 T G_0 \label{green}
\eeq
The conduction electron Green's function can be calculated as
\beq
G_c(k,k^\prime,E) = \delta_{k,k^\prime}G^0_c(k,E) + G_c^0(k)t G^0_f t G^0_c(k^\prime) + \\ G_c^0(k)t G^0_f t \sum_q G_c^0(q) t G^0_f t G^0_c(k^\prime) + ...\\
\eeq
Noting that 
\beq
t\sum_q G_c^0(q)t = \Sigma_c,
\eeq
we have
\beq
G_c(k,k^\prime,E) = \delta_{k,k^\prime}G^0_c(k,E) + G_c^0(k)t^2 G_f(E)G_c^0(k)
\eeq
Comparing with the final form of \il{G} in eq.~\ref{green}, we can write
\beq[tm]
T(k,k^\prime,E) = t^2 G_d(E) = \fr{t^2}{E-\epsilon_d + i\Delta}=-\fr{t^2}{\Delta} \fr{1}{\fr{ \epsilon_d- E}{\Delta}-i}
\eeq
As an aside, this form of the transition matrix allows us to make a connection:
\beq[dsfromtmat]
\text{Im}[T] = -\fr{t^2 \Delta}{\rr{E-\epsilon_d}^2+\Delta^2} = -\pi t^2 \rho_d
\eeq
The density of states of the impurity site is proportional to the imaginary part of the transition matrix element.
This is a general relation, because
\beq
\rho_d = -\fr{1}{\pi}\text{Im}\qq{G_d} = -\fr{1}{\pi t^2}\text{Im}\qq{t^2 G_d} = -\fr{1}{\pi t^2}\text{Im}\qq{T}
\eeq
This relation will hold as long as the \il{T-}matrix is of the form \il{t^2 G_d}.
\\\\
If the phase shift of the conduction electrons due to scattering off the impurity is \il{\delta}, we have
\beq
T = e^{2i\delta} - 1 = e^{i\delta}\rr{e^{i\delta} - e^{-i\delta}} \sim \fr{1}{\cot \delta - i}
\eeq
Comparing with eq.~\ref{tm}, we can write
\beq[phaseshift]
\delta(E) = \cot^{-1}\rr{\fr{\epsilon_d - E}{\Delta}}
\eeq
When \il{E = \epsilon_d}, the phase shift is \il{\pi}, and the scattering is head on (the conduction electron is reflected back).
Comparing with eq.~\ref{total},
\beq
\fr{2}{\pi}\delta(0) = \avg{n_d}
\eeq
This is an example of the Friedel sum rule which states that the total number of electrons bound inside a resonance is \il{\fr{1}{\pi}} times the total scattering phase shift at the Fermi surface.
In other words, the impurity will be singly occupied when \il{\delta(0) = \fr{\pi}{2}}.

\subsubsection{Coulomb blockade}
A quantum dot is a set of electrons that are localised in a sufficiently small region so that their spectrum is quantised.
The localization means that double occupation will come at a cost of \il{U}.
\beq
H_\text{dot} = \sum_{m\sigma} \epsilon_m n_{m\sigma} + U\fr{N(N+1)}{2}
\eeq
\il{\epsilon_m} are the single-particle energy levels.
\il{N =\sum_{m\sigma} n_{m\sigma}} is the total number of electrons.
 Switching on a voltage \il{V} across the dot shifts the energy levels, creating the possibility of conduction.
\beq
H_\text{dot} = \sum_{m\sigma} \rr{\epsilon_m -eV} n_{m\sigma} + U\fr{N(N+1)}{2}
\eeq
\il{e} is positive.
The energy difference between \il{n_{N}=1} and \il{n_N = 2} levels is
\beq
\Delta E = UN + \epsilon_{N} -eV
\eeq
Tuning the voltage can make these two levels degenerate.
\beq
eV^* = UN + \epsilon_{N}
\eeq
At this voltage, the two levels have the same energy and double occupancy becomes possible.
Electrons can flow from the source to the sink via double occupation on the dot.\\\\
For a non-interacting resonance, the conductance can be calculated as follows.
The conductance for perfect transmission is given by the quantum of conductance \il{G_0 = \fr{2e^2}{h}}.
In this case, the transmission is not perfect, but is modulated by the density of states of the dot at the Fermi surface.
Hence,
\beq
G(V) = G_0 \rho(0) = \fr{2e^2}{h} \fr{\Delta^2}{\rr{\epsilon_m - eV}^2 + \Delta^2}
\eeq
The conductance is maximum whenever \il{\epsilon_m = eV}.


\subsection{Total Hamiltonian: Mean field treatment}
\begin{gather}
n_{d\ua}n_{d\da} \approx n_{d\ua}\avg{n_{d\da}} + n_{d\da}\avg{n_{d\ua}} + \text{constant}\\
H \approx \sum_k \epsilon_k n_k + \sum_\sigma \qq{\epsilon_d+U \avg{n_{d\ol \sigma}}}n_{d\sigma} + t\sum_{k\sigma}\rr{c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c_{d\sigma}+c^\dagger_{d\sigma}c_{k\sigma}}
\end{gather}
The only change is \il{\epsilon_d \ra \epsilon_{d\sigma} = \epsilon_d + U\avg{n_{d\bar\sigma}}}.
This allows us to write
\beq[rho]
\rho_{d\sigma} = \fr{1}{\pi}\fr{\Delta}{(E-\epsilon_{d\sigma})^2 + \Delta^2} \implies \avg{n_{d\sigma}} = \int \rho_{d\sigma} = \fr{1}{\pi}\cot^{-1}\rr{\fr{\epsilon_{d\sigma}}{\Delta}}
\eeq
An alternative way of writing that is
\beq[density]
\fr{\epsilon_{d\sigma}}{\Delta} = \fr{\epsilon_d + U\avg{n_{d\sigma}}}{\Delta} =  \cot\rr{\pi\avg{n_{d\sigma}}} \implies \avg{n_{d\sigma}} = \fr{\Delta}{U}\qq{{\cot\rr{\pi\avg{n_{d\ol\sigma}}} - \fr{\epsilon_d}{\Delta}}}
\eeq
Introducing \il{n_d = \avg{n_{d\ua}} + \avg{n_{d\da}}} and \il{m = \avg{n_{d\ua}} - \avg{n_{d\da}}}, we can write
\beq
\avg{n_{d\ua} - n_{d\da}} \equiv m = \fr{\Delta}{U}\qq{\cot\rr{\pi\avg{n_{d\da}}}-\cot\rr{\pi\avg{n_{d\ua}}}} \\= \fr{\Delta}{U}\qq{\cot\fr{\pi}{2}\rr{n_d-m}-\cot\fr{\pi}{2}\rr{n_d+m}}
\eeq
We want to find the critical condition for the onset of magnetism.
This occurs when \il{m \ra 0^+}.
This means we can expand the \il{\cot} around \il{m=0}.
Since
\beq
\cot (a+x) \approx \cot a -x\rr{\sin a}^{-2} \implies \cot (a-x) - \cot(a+x) \approx 2x\rr{\sin a}^{-2}
\eeq
we get
\beq[final]
m = \fr{\Delta}{U}\qq{-\pi\fr{ m}{\sin^2 \fr{\pi}{2} n_d}} \implies 1 = \lim_{m \ra 0}\fr{U}{\pi \Delta}\fr{1}{1+\cot^2\fr{\pi n_d}{2}}
\eeq
At \il{m=0}, \il{\avg{n_{d\ua}} = \avg{n_{d\da}}}, therefore \il{\cot \fr{\pi n_d}{2} = \fr{U n_d}{2\Delta}+\fr{\epsilon_d}{\Delta}}.
Substituting in eq.~\ref{final},
\beq
1 = \fr{U_c}{\pi}\fr{\Delta}{\Delta^2+\rr{\fr{U_c n_d}{2}+\epsilon_d}^2}
\eeq
Magnetism will prevail for \il{U \geq U_c}.
Comparing with eq.~\ref{density},
\beq
1 = U_c \rho_d(E=0)
\eeq
At half-filling, \il{n_d = 1} and \il{\epsilon_d = -\fr{U}{2}}, which gives
\beq
U_c = \pi \Delta
\eeq
For higher values of \il{U}, we get a value of \il{m} far from \il{0}.
This provides two peaks in the density of states.
\begin{gather}
\avg{n_{d\ua}} = \fr{1+m}{2}\\
\avg{n_{d\da}} = \fr{1-m}{2}\\
\epsilon_{d\sigma} = \epsilon_d + U\avg{n_{d\overline\sigma}} = \epsilon_d + \fr{U}{2} \pm \fr{U}{2}m = \pm \fr{U}{2}m\\
\rho_d = \rho_{d\ua} + \rho_{d\da} = \fr{\Delta}{\pi}\qq{\fr{1}{\Delta^2 + \rr{E - \fr{Um}{2}}^2}+\fr{1}{\Delta^2 + \rr{E + \fr{Um}{2}}^2}}
\end{gather}
We get two Lorentzian peaks at \il{E = \pm \fr{Um}{2}}, depending on whichever polarization the impurity local moment is in.

\subsection{Some points:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The mean field solution predicts that local moments are sustained in the limit of large \il{U} and small \il{|\epsilon_d|}.
	\item This treatment becomes faulty at low temperatures.
	\item At low temperatures, the resistivity is found to reach a minimum and then vary as \il{\ln T}.
	\item This behaviour stops at some very low temperature \il{T_K}.
	\item The temperature \il{T_K} is also that at which the magnetisation vanishes, and the susceptibility becomes constant, suggesting that the impurity spin has condensed into a singlet.
	\item Since the disappearance of the \il{\ln T} behaviour is coincident with the condensation of the spin degree of freedom, it is natural to hope that the resistivity minimum is a result of the interaction between the impurity and the conduction spins.
	\item To describe such an interaction, the way to proceed is to strip the model of the charge excitations (via a \it{Schrieffer-Wolff transformation}).
The resultant Hamiltonian consists of an antiferromagnetic interaction between the itinerant spins and the impurity spin, and is called the Kondo model.
	\item Calculating the scattering rate up to second order using the Kondo model produces a logarithmic term, which explains the log-dependence.
	\item Since this perturbative treatment will fail at small temperatures (where the log term diverges), we need some other technique to find out the fate of the model at low temperatures.
	\item Anderson's poor man's scaling wraps the effects of high energy scatterings into the low energy model, showing that the antiferromagnetic coupling diverges at low temperatures, producing a singlet.
	\item There are two routes that one can follow to note the changes in the system; one is by reducing the temperature which is equivalent to folding in the high energy fluctuations, aka scaling.
The other is to reduce the onsite interaction \il{U} and note the changes in state.
	\item Reducing the temperature or performing the RG takes the model from the Anderson model (\il{T>0}) to the Fermi liquid state (\il{T \sim T_K}).
This Fermi liquid may have interactions, depending on the value of \il{U} we are working in.
	\item Coming down to \il{T<T_K}, we can now modify the \il{U} from \il{\infty} to 0.
Large \il{U} means the Fermi liquid has large interactions.
Reducing \il{U} means coming down to a Fermi gas.
For \il{T\neq 0}, reducing \il{U} means going from local moment regime to non-magnetic regime.
For \il{T=0}, local moments persist for all \il{U>0}.
	\item It will be seen that in the large \il{U} regime, the singlet channel scattering phase shift (phase shift incurred when one singlet state scatters into another singlet state) at the Fermi energy is \il{\propto \tan^{-1} J_\text{eff}}.
This effective coupling \il{J_\text{eff}} flows to \il{\infty} under poor man's scaling as \il{T \ra 0}.
Thus, the singlet phase shift at \il{\epsilon_F} approaches \il{\fr{\pi}{2}} as \il{T \ra 0}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Derivation of the Kondo Hamiltonian:}
The space of the impurity electron can be divided into low energy and high energy subspaces:
\beq
\text{low energy (L)} \ra \begin{cases} \ket{\ua} \\ \ket{\da} \end{cases}\\
\text{high energy (H)} \ra \begin{cases} \ket{} \\ \ket{\ua\da} \end{cases}\\
\eeq
\beq
H = H_0 + V = \bordermatrix{~ & \text{low} & \text{high} \cr 
\text{low} & H^L & v^\dagger \cr
	   &&\cr
\text{high} & v & H^H }
\eeq
\beq
H_0 = \sum_{k}\epsilon_k n_{k}+ \epsilon_d n_d + U n_{d\ua}n_{d\da}, V=\sum_{k\sigma}\rr{V_k c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c_{d\sigma} +V_k^* c^\dagger_{d\sigma}c_{k\sigma}}
\eeq
Let \il{S} be some anti-Hermitian operator, of the order of \il{V}.
Expanding in powers of \il{V},
\beq
\ol H = e^{-S} H e^S = H_0 + \rr{V+\qq{H_0,S}} + \hf\rr{\qq{V,S}+\qq{\qq{H_0,S},S}}
\eeq
Defining \il{S} such that the first order term vanishes,
\begin{gather}
	V = \qq{S,H_0} \label{sdef}\\
\ol H = H_0 + \hf\qq{V,S}
\end{gather}
Take \il{S = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -s^\dagger \\ s & 0 \end{pmatrix}}.
From eq.~\ref{sdef},
\beq
V = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -s^\dagger \\ s & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} H^L & 0 \\ 0 & H^H \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} H^L & 0 \\ 0 & H^H \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -s^\dagger \\ s & 0 \end{pmatrix} \\= \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -s^\dagger H^H+H^L s^\dagger \\ s H^L - H^H s & 0 \end{pmatrix}
\eeq 
Comparing with the definition of \il{V}, we can write
\begin{gather}
v^\dagger_{ij} = s^\dagger_{ij}\rr{E^L_i - E^H_j}, v_{ij} = s_{ij}\rr{E^L_j - E^H_i}\\
\implies s^\dagger_{ij} = \fr{v^\dagger_{ij}}{E^L_i - E^H_j}, s_{ij} = \fr{v_{ij}}{E^L_j - E^H_i}
\end{gather}
From the structure of \il{S}, it is clear that \il{i \in H, j \in L}.
\beq
\qq{V,S} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & v^\dagger \\ v & 0 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -s^\dagger \\ s & 0 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -s^\dagger \\ s & 0 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 0 & v^\dagger \\ v & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} v^\dagger s + s^\dagger v & 0 \\ 0 & -vs^\dagger -sv^\dagger \end{pmatrix}
\eeq
Hence,
\beq
\ol H = H_0 + \fr{\qq{V,S}}{2} = \begin{pmatrix} H^L + \hf\rr{v^\dagger s + s^\dagger v} & 0 \\ 0 & H^H -vs^\dagger -sv^\dagger \end{pmatrix}
\eeq
Since we want the low energy excitations, the effective low-energy Hamiltonian is
\beq
\ham = \bra{L} \ol H \ket{L} = H^L + \hf\rr{v^\dagger s + s^\dagger v}
\eeq
where \il{H^L = \sum_\sigma \bra{\sigma_d} H_0 \ket{\sigma_d} = \epsilon_d n_d + \sum_{k} n_{k}}.
Now,
\beq
\Delta H = \hf\rr{v^\dagger s + s^\dagger v} &= \hf\rr{v^\dagger \sum_{HL} s_{HL}\ket{H}\bra{L} + \text{h.c.}} \\
&= \hf\sum_{HL}\qq{v^\dagger \ket{H}\bra{L}\fr{v_{HL}}{E_L - E_H} + \ket{L}\bra{H} \fr{v^\dagger_{LH}}{E_L - E_H}v}
\eeq
Taking a matrix element between two low energy states \il{l, l^\prime}, we get
\beq
\Delta H_{ll^\prime} = \bra{l} \Delta H \ket{l^\prime} &= \hf\sum_H v^\dagger_{lH}v_{Hl^\prime}\rr{\fr{1}{E_{l^\prime} - E_H}+\fr{1}{E_l - E_H}}
\eeq
This can also be written as
\beq[hamtmat]
\Delta H_{ll^\prime} = \hf\qq{T_{ll^\prime}(E_l) + T_{ll^\prime}(E_{l^\prime})}
\eeq
where 
\beq
T_{ll^\prime}(E) = \sum_H \fr{v^\dagger_{lH}v_{Hl^\prime}}{E-E_H} = \sum_H \fr{V^\dagger_{lH} V_{Hl^\prime}}{E-E_H}
\eeq
\il{T(E)}, here, is the second order contribution of the \il{T-}matrix due to scattering off the interaction \il{V}.
The \il{\ket{H}} act as the intermediate states during the second order scatterings.
This is a slight generalization from second order perturbation theory.
In second order perturbation, we only consider the scattering amplitude between the same states, but here we consider the scattering between two potentially different states \il{\ket{l},\ket{l^\prime}}.
The total amplitude is an average of these two amplitudes.
\\\\If we assume the high energy subspace is very far away from the low energy one (\il{E_H \gg E_L}), we can assume \il{E_l \approx E_{l^\prime} = E_L}, we can write
\beq
\Delta H_{ll^\prime} &=\sum_H v^\dagger_{lH}v_{Hl^\prime}\fr{1}{E_L-E_H}\\
\implies \Delta H &=V \rr{\sum_H \fr{1}{\Delta_{LH}}\ket{H}\bra{H}}V
\eeq
where \il{\Delta_{LH}=E_L - E_H} is the energy difference between the low energy subspace and the high energy state \il{\ket{H}}.
For our Hamiltonian, \il{\ket{H_1} = \ket{0}, \ket{H_2} = \ket{\ua\da}}.
Therefore,
\beq
\Delta_{LH_1} = \epsilon_d - 0 = \epsilon_d, \Delta_{LH_2} = \epsilon_d - \rr{2\epsilon_d + U} = -\epsilon_d - U
\eeq
Also, \il{V = \sum_{k\sigma}\qq{V(k) c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c_{d\sigma} + V^*(k) c^\dagger_{d\sigma}c_{k\sigma}}}.
Hence,
\beq
\Delta H &= V\fr{\ket{0}\bra{0}}{\epsilon_d}V - V\fr{\ket{\ua\da}\bra{\ua\da}}{\epsilon_d + U}V\\
	 &= \sum_{k_1,k_2,\sigma_1,\sigma_2}V(k_1)V^*(k_2)\qq{\fr{c^\dagger_{d\sigma_2} c_{k_2 \sigma_2}\ket{0}\bra{0}c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1} c_{d \sigma_1}}{\epsilon_d} - \fr{c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1} c_{d \sigma_1}\ket{\ua\da}\bra{\ua\da}c^\dagger_{d\sigma_2} c_{k_2 \sigma_2}}{\epsilon_d+U}}\\
&=\sum_{k_1,k_2,\sigma_1,\sigma_2}V(k_1)V^*(k_2)\fr{c^\dagger_{d\sigma_2} c_{k_2 \sigma_2}c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1} c_{d \sigma_1}\ket{d\sigma_1,h_{k_1\sigma_1}}\bra{d\sigma_1,h_{k_1\sigma_1}}}{\epsilon_d} \\
&- \sum_{k_1,k_2,\sigma_1,\sigma_2}V(k_1)V^*(k_2)\fr{c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1} c_{d \sigma_1}c^\dagger_{d\sigma_2} c_{k_2 \sigma_2}\ket{d\ol{\sigma_2},e_{k_2\sigma_2}}\bra{d\ol{\sigma_2},e_{k_2\sigma_2}}}{\epsilon_d+U}\\
&=\sum_{k_1,k_2,\sigma_1,\sigma_2}V(k_1)V^*(k_2)\qq{\fr{c^\dagger_{d\sigma_2} c_{k_2 \sigma_2}c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1} c_{d \sigma_1}}{\epsilon_d} - \fr{c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1} c_{d \sigma_1}c^\dagger_{d\sigma_2} c_{k_2 \sigma_2}}{\epsilon_d+U}}P_{n_d=1}
\eeq
Using Fierz indentity \il{\delta_{\sigma_1\sigma_3}\delta_{\sigma_4\sigma_2} = \hf\delta_{\sigma_1\sigma_2}\delta_{\sigma_3\sigma_4} + \hf\vec\sigma_{\sigma_1\sigma_2}\cdot\vec\sigma_{\sigma_3\sigma_4}}, we can write
\beq
c^\dagger_{d\sigma_2} c_{k_2 \sigma_2}c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1} c_{d \sigma_1} &= \sum_{\sigma_3,\sigma_4}c^\dagger_{d\sigma_3} c_{k_2 \sigma_2}c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1} c_{d \sigma_4}\delta_{\sigma_1\sigma_3}\delta_{\sigma_4\sigma_2}\\
&=\hf\sum_{\sigma_3,\sigma_4}c^\dagger_{d\sigma_3} c_{k_2 \sigma_2}c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1} c_{d \sigma_4}\rr{\delta_{\sigma_1\sigma_2}\delta_{\sigma_3\sigma_4} + \vec\sigma_{\sigma_1\sigma_2}\cdot\vec\sigma_{\sigma_3\sigma_4}}\\
&=\hf c_{k_2 \sigma_1}c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1}n_d+c_{k_2 \sigma_2}c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1}\vec\sigma_{\sigma_1\sigma_2}\cdot\sum_{\sigma_3,\sigma_4}c^\dagger_{d\sigma_3}\fr{\vec \sigma_{\sigma_3\sigma_4}}{2}c_{d\sigma_4}
\eeq
Now, \il{c_{k_2 \sigma_1}c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1} = \delta_{k_1,k_2}-c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1}c_{k_2 \sigma_1}}, and  \il{c_{k_2 \sigma_2}c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1} = \delta_{\sigma_1,\sigma_2}\delta_{k_1,k_2}-c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1}c_{k_2 \sigma_1}}.
The \il{\delta} will result in terms that have no interaction, so we drop these terms.
Also, the \il{P_{n_d=1}} ensures we can substitute \il{n_d=1}.
\beq
c^\dagger_{d\sigma_2} c_{k_2 \sigma_2}c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1} c_{d \sigma_1} &= -\hf c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1}c_{k_2 \sigma_1} - c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1}\vec\sigma_{\sigma_1\sigma_2}c_{k_2 \sigma_2}\cdot\sum_{\sigma_3,\sigma_4}c^\dagger_{d\sigma_3}\fr{\vec\sigma_{\sigma_3\sigma_4}}{2}c_{d\sigma_4}\\
\eeq
Since the first term does not have any spin-spin interaction, we drop that term.

Defining \il{\vec \sigma_d = \sum_{\sigma_3,\sigma_4}c^\dagger_{d\sigma_3}\vec\sigma_{\sigma_3\sigma_4}c_{d\sigma_4}}, we have
\beq
c^\dagger_{d\sigma_2} c_{k_2 \sigma_2}c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1} c_{d \sigma_1} =-\hf c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1}\vec\sigma_{\sigma_1\sigma_2}c_{k_2 \sigma_2}\cdot \vec \sigma_d
\eeq
Similarly,
\beq
c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1} c_{d \sigma_1} c^\dagger_{d\sigma_2} c_{k_2 \sigma_2}=-\hf c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1}\vec\sigma_{\sigma_1\sigma_2}c_{k_2 \sigma_2}\cdot \vec \sigma_d
\eeq
Finally, putting all this together,
\beq
\Delta H = \hf\sum_{k_1,k_2,\sigma_1,\sigma_2}V(k_1)V^*(k_2)\qq{\fr{1}{\epsilon_d+U}-\fr{1}{\epsilon_d}}c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1}\vec\sigma_{\sigma_1\sigma_2}c_{k_2 \sigma_2}\cdot \vec \sigma_d \\
= \hf\sum_{k_1,k_2,\sigma_1,\sigma_2} J(k_1,k_2)c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1}\vec\sigma_{\sigma_1\sigma_2}c_{k_2 \sigma_2}\cdot \vec \sigma_d
\eeq
where
\beq[jexpr]
J(k_1,k_2) = V(k_1)V^*(k_2)\qq{\fr{1}{\epsilon_d+U}-\fr{1}{\epsilon_d}}
\eeq
Assuming \il{V(k) \equiv t},
\beq
H_K = \sum_k \epsilon_k n_k + \fr{J}{2} \vec \sigma_e \cdot \vec \sigma_d
\eeq
where
\beq
\vec \sigma_e = \sum_{k_1,k_2,\sigma_1,\sigma_2}c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1}\vec\sigma_{\sigma_1\sigma_2}c_{k_2 \sigma_2} = \sum_{\sigma_1,\sigma_2}c^\dagger_{\sigma_1}(\vec r = 0)\vec\sigma_{\sigma_1\sigma_2}c_{\sigma_2}(\vec r = 0)
\eeq
\il{\vec \sigma_e} is thus the spin density at the origin.

\subsection{Obtaining the resistivity minimum and \il{\log}-dependence}
The model we are working with is
\beq
H_K &= H_0 + V = \sum_k \epsilon_k n_k + \fr{J}{2} \sum_{k_1,k_2,\sigma_1,\sigma_2}c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1}\vec \sigma_d \cdot \vec\sigma_{\sigma_1\sigma_2}c_{k_2 \sigma_2}
\eeq
\beq
\sum_{\sigma_1,\sigma_2}c^\dagger_{k_1\sigma_1}\vec \sigma_d \cdot \vec\sigma_{\sigma_1\sigma_2}c_{k_2 \sigma_2} = \sigma_d^z\rr{c^\dagger_{k_1\ua}c_{k_2\ua} - c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\da}} +\sigma_d^x\rr{c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\ua} + c^\dagger_{k_1\ua}c_{k_2\da}} \\
-i \sigma_d^y\rr{ c^\dagger_{k_1\ua}c_{k_2\da}- c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\ua}}
\eeq
\beq
=\sigma_d^z\rr{c^\dagger_{k_1\ua}c_{k_2\ua} - c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\da}} + c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\ua}\sigma_d^+ + c^\dagger_{k_1\ua}c_{k_2\da}\sigma_d^-
\eeq
where \il{\sigma^\pm = \sigma^x \pm i \sigma^y}.
Therefore,
\beq
H_K &=\sum_k \epsilon_k n_k + \fr{J}{2} \sum_{k_1,k_2}\qq{\sigma_d^z\rr{c^\dagger_{k_1\ua}c_{k_2\ua} - c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\da}}+\sigma_d^+ c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\ua} + \sigma_d^- c^\dagger_{k_1\ua}c_{k_2\da}}\\
    &=\sum_k \epsilon_k n_k + J \sum_{k_1,k_2}\qq{S_d^z\rr{c^\dagger_{k_1\ua}c_{k_2\ua} - c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\da}}+S_d^+ c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\ua} + S_d^- c^\dagger_{k_1\ua}c_{k_2\da}}
\eeq
To see the \il{\log-}dependence, we need to calculate the transition matrix up to second order:
\beq
T = V + V G_0 V
\eeq
We wish to calculate the scattering probability of a conduction electron \il{\ket{k \ua}}.
\subsubsection{First order scattering}
\begin{center}
$\left.\begin{tabular}{@{}l@{}}

%\il{\ket{k \da, d_\ua} \ra \ket{q \ua, d_\da}}\\
\end{tabular}\right\}$ pro-spin-flip
\end{center}
For non-flip, the matrix elements for the \il{T-}matrix is
\beq
T^{(1)}_\text{nonflip} = T_{k_\ua,d_{\sigma} \ra q_\ua,d_{\sigma}} = \bra{q_\ua,d_{\sigma}}V\ket{k_\ua,d_{\sigma}} = m_d J
\eeq
where \il{m_d \in \{-s_d, s_d\}} is the spin of the impurity electron.
The probability for this scattering is
\beq
\mathcal{P}_{k_\sigma,d_{\sigma^\prime} \ra q_\sigma,d_{\sigma^\prime}} = 2\pi\sum_{\epsilon} \rho(\epsilon)T_{k_\ua,d_{\sigma} \ra q_\ua,d_{\sigma}}^2 = 2\pi \rho(0) J^2 m_d^2
\eeq
Since we are considering scattering close to the Fermi surface, we replaced the sum with \il{\rho(0)}.

\beq
\mathcal{P}_1 = 2\pi\rho(0)J^2 m_d^2
\eeq
For spin-flip, the matrix element is
\beq
T^{(1)}_\text{flip} =T_{k_\ua,d_{\da} \ra q_\da,d_{\ua}} = \bra{q_\da,d_{\ua}}V\ket{k_\ua,d_{\da}} = \lambda_+ J
\eeq
where \il{\lambda_\pm = \bra{m_d \pm 1} S_d^\pm \ket{m_d} = \sqrt{s_d(s_d+1)-m_d(m_d\pm 1)}}.
The probability for this scattering is hence
\beq
\mathcal{P}_2 = \mathcal{P}_{k_\ua,d_{\da} \ra q_\da,d_{\ua}} = 2\pi \rho(0) J \qq{s_d(s_d+1)-m_d(m_d + 1)}
\eeq
The total first order scattering probability is (averaged over all configurations of the impurity)
\beq
\mathcal{P}^{(1)} = \fr{1}{2s_d+1}\sum_{m_d = -s_d}^{s_d}\rr{\mathcal{P}_1 + \mathcal{P}_2} = \fr{2\pi \rho(0) J^2}{(2s_d+1)}\sum_{m_d = -s_d}^{s_d}\rr{s_d(s_d+1) - m_d} \\
= 2\pi \rho(0)J^2 s_d(s_d+1)

The second order transition matrix contribution is of the form
\beq
T^{(2)}_{i \ra j} = \bra{j} V G_0 V \ket{i} = \sum_l \fr{\bra{j}V\ket{l}\bra{l}V\ket{i}}{E_i - E_l}
\eeq
The sum is over all the intermediate states in going from \il{\ket{i}} to \il{\ket{k}}.
For no flipping of the conduction electron, there are four possible processes.
The first process has the following \it{T}-matrix:
\beq
T^{(2)}_{11}&=\sum_q\fr{\bra{k^\prime_\ua d_\sigma}V\ket{q_\ua d_\sigma}\bra{q_\ua d_\sigma}V\ket{k_\ua d_\sigma}}{\epsilon_k-\epsilon_q}\\
      &= \rr{J m_d}^2\sum_q \fr{1-P(q)}{\epsilon_k - \epsilon_q} = J^2 m_d^2 \sum_q \fr{1-P(q)}{\epsilon_k - \epsilon_q}
\eeq
where \il{m_d = \bra{d_\sigma}S_d^z\ket{d_\sigma}} and \il{1-P(q)} is the probability that the state \il{q\ua} is empty.
For the second process,
\beq
T^{(2)}_{12} = \sum_q \fr{\bra{q_\ua k^\prime_\ua d_\sigma} V \ket{k^\prime_\ua k_\ua d_\sigma}\bra{k^\prime_\ua k_\ua d_\sigma}V\ket{q_\ua k_\ua d_\sigma}}{\epsilon_q - \epsilon_{k^\prime}}P(q)
\eeq
Note that if \il{\bra{k^\prime k}V\ket{q k} \sim \bra{k^\prime k} c^\dagger_{k^\prime}c_q\ket{q k} = 1}, then \il{\bra{q k^\prime }V\ket{k^\prime k} \sim \bra{qk^\prime }c^\dagger_q c_k\ket{k^\prime k} =}\\\il{ -\bra{qk^\prime }c^\dagger_q c_k\ket{k k^\prime} = -1}.
Assuming the scattering conserves energy \il{(\epsilon_k = \epsilon_k^\prime)}, we get
\beq
T^{(2)}_{12} = -J^2 m_d^2\sum_q\fr{P(q)}{\epsilon_q - \epsilon_{k}} = J^2 m_d^2 \sum_q \fr{P(q)}{\epsilon_k - \epsilon_q}
\eeq
For the third process,
\beq
T^{(2)}_{13}=\sum_q\fr{\bra{k^\prime_\ua d_\da}V\ket{q_\da d_\ua}\bra{q_\da d_\ua}V\ket{k_\ua d_\da}}{\epsilon_k-\epsilon_q}
\eeq
Using \il{\bra{m_d\pm 1}S_d^\pm\ket{m_d} = \sqrt{s_d(s_d+1)-m_d(m_d\pm 1)} = \lambda_\pm}, we get
\beq
T^{(2)}_{13} = \lambda_+^2J^2 \sum_q \fr{1-P(q)}{\epsilon_k-\epsilon_q}
\eeq
For the fourth process,
\beq
T^{(2)}_{14}&=\sum_q\fr{\bra{q_\da k^\prime_\ua d_\ua}V\ket{k^\prime_\ua k_\ua d_\da}\bra{k^\prime_\ua k_\ua d_\da}V\ket{q_\da k_\ua d_\ua}}{\epsilon_q-\epsilon_k^\prime}\\
      &=-\lambda_-^2J^2 \sum_q \fr{P(q)}{\epsilon_q-\epsilon_k}\\
      &=\lambda_-^2J^2 \sum_q \fr{P(q)}{\epsilon_k-\epsilon_q}
\eeq
The sum of all the elements gives the transition matrix element for the scattering \il{k\ua \ra k^\prime\ua}:
\beq
T^{(2)}_{\text{nonflip}} = \sum_{i=1}^4 T^{(2)}_{1i} &= J^2 \sum_q \fr{m_d^2 + \lambda_+^2 -P(q)\rr{\lambda_+^2 - \lambda_-^2}}{\epsilon_k-\epsilon_q}\\
&= J^2 \sum_q \fr{s(s+1)-m_d + 2m_dP(q)}{\epsilon_k-\epsilon_q}\\
&= J^2\qq{s(s+1)-m_d}(\alpha+\gamma) + 2 J^2 m_d \gamma
\eeq
where \il{\gamma = \sum_q\fr{P(q)}{\epsilon_k-\epsilon_q},\alpha = \sum_q\fr{1-P_q}{\epsilon_k- \epsilon_q}}.
The second term has the Fermi-Dirac distribution and hence is the only temperature dependent term.
Accordingly, we drop the first term.
\beq
T^{(2)}_{\text{nonflip}} &= 2 J^2 m_d \gamma\\
			 &=2J^2 m_d \int d\epsilon N(\epsilon) \fr{P(\epsilon)}{\epsilon_k - \epsilon} = \fr{\sqrt 2 J^2 m_d m^{\fr{3}{2}}}{\pi^2 \hbar^3}\int d\epsilon \fr{\sqrt \epsilon P(\epsilon)}{\epsilon_k - \epsilon}
\eeq
Assuming \il{T=0}, \il{P(\epsilon) = \theta(\epsilon_F - \epsilon)}.
Then
\beq
T^{(2)}_{\text{nonflip}} &=\fr{\sqrt 2 J^2 m_d m^{\fr{3}{2}}}{\pi^2 \hbar^3}\sqrt{\epsilon_k}\ln \bigg\vert \fr{\sqrt{\epsilon_k}+\sqrt{\epsilon_{F}}}{\sqrt {\epsilon_k}-\sqrt{\epsilon_{F}}} \bigg\vert \\
    &= \fr{\sqrt 2 J^2 m_d m^{\fr{3}{2}}}{\pi^2 \hbar^3}\sqrt{\epsilon_k} \ln \bigg\vert \fr{\epsilon_k + \epsilon_{F} + 2\sqrt{\epsilon_k \epsilon_F}}{\epsilon_k-\epsilon_{F}} \bigg\vert 
\eeq
For \il{T >0} but \il{\ll T_F}, the excitation energy of the electrons is very small and of the order of \il{k_B T}.
Hence, we can replace \il{\epsilon_k - \epsilon_F = k_B T} and everywhere else replace \il{\epsilon_k = \epsilon_F}.

\beq
T^{(2)}_{\text{nonflip}} = \fr{\sqrt 2 J^2 m_d m^{\fr{3}{2}}}{\pi^2 \hbar^3}\sqrt{\epsilon_F} \ln \bigg\vert \fr{4T_F}{T} \bigg\vert 
\eeq
Dropping the temperature-independent \il{\log 4} term and recognizing \il{N(\epsilon_F)} in the pre-factor,
\beq
T^{(2)}_{\text{nonflip}} = 2J^2 m_d N(\epsilon_F) \ln \bigg\vert \fr{T_F}{T} \bigg\vert 
\eeq
Adding the first order non-flip contribution (\il{T^{(1)}_\text{nonflip}}) to the \il{T-}matrix, we get
\beq
T_\text{nonflip} = J m_d\qq{1+2N(\epsilon_F) J \ln \fr{T_F}{T}}
\eeq
The upshot is that the additional contribution in second order is obtained by replacing \il{J \ra 2J N(\epsilon_F) \ln \fr{T_F}{T}}.
For the spin-flip scatterings (processes 5\uu{th} to 8\uu{th}),
\beq
T^{(2)}_{21} &= -J^2 (m_d+1)\lambda_+\sum_q\fr{1-P_q}{\epsilon_k- \epsilon_q}\\
T^{(2)}_{23} &= J^2 m_d \lambda_+\sum_q\fr{1-P_q}{\epsilon_k- \epsilon_q}\\
T^{(2)}_{22} &= J^2 (m_d+1) \lambda_+  \sum_q \fr{P(q)}{\epsilon_k - \epsilon_q}\\
T^{(2)}_{24} &= -\lambda_+ m_d J^2 \sum_q \fr{P(q)}{\epsilon_k-\epsilon_q}
\eeq
\beq
T^{(2)}_\text{flip} = -J^2 \lambda_+ \rr{\alpha - \gamma}
\eeq
The total spin-flip matrix element (temperature-dependent part) is
\beq
T^{(2)}_\text{flip} &= 2 J^2 \lambda_+ \sum_q \fr{P(q)}{\epsilon_k - \epsilon_q} \\
     &= 2 J^2 \lambda_+ N(\epsilon_F) \ln \bigg\vert \fr{T_F}{T} \bigg\vert 
\eeq
Adding the first order contribution,
\beq
T_\text{flip} = \lambda_+ J \qq{1 + 2 N(\epsilon_F) J \ln \fr{T}{T_F}}
\eeq
Here again, the second order contribution is obtained by replacing \\
\il{J \ra 2J N(\epsilon_F) \ln \fr{T_F}{T}}.
Both the solutions together imply that the next order probability for scattering of \il{k\ua} is obtained by replacing the additional \il{J} with \il{2J N(\epsilon_F) \ln \fr{T_F}{T}}.
\beq[change]
\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{P}^{(2)}\qq{1 + 2J N(\epsilon_F) \ln \fr{T_F}{T}}
\eeq

\subsection{The Kondo resonance}
Since \il{V} conserves total angular momentum, \il{\bra{s}V\ket{s^\prime} \sim \delta_{s s^\prime}}.
Hence
\beq
T_{a \ra b} = \sum_{s,m_s} |\langle{s,m_s}|{a}\rangle|^2 T_s
\eeq
Now, \il{\ket{k \ua, d_\ua} = \ket{s=1}}, so
\beq
T_{\ket{k \ua, d_\ua} \ra \ket{k^\prime \ua d_\ua}} = T_1
\eeq
But.
since \il{\ket{k \ua, d_\da} = \fr{\ket{s=1}+\ket{s=0}}{\sqrt 2}},
\beq
T_{\ket{k \ua, d_\da} \ra \ket{k^\prime \ua d_\da}} = \fr{T_1 + T_0}{2}
\eeq
and \il{\ket{k \da, d_\ua} = \fr{\ket{s=1}-\ket{s=0}}{\sqrt 2}},
\beq
T_{\ket{k \ua, d_\da} \ra \ket{k^\prime \da d_\ua}} = \fr{T_1 - T_0}{2}
\eeq
Therefore,
\beq
T_1 = T_{\ket{k \ua, d_\da} \ra \ket{k^\prime \ua d_\da}} + T_{\ket{k \ua, d_\da} \ra \ket{k^\prime \da d_\ua}} = T_\text{nonflip} + T_\text{flip}\\
T_0 = T_{\ket{k \ua, d_\da} \ra \ket{k^\prime \ua d_\da}} - T_{\ket{k \ua, d_\da} \ra \ket{k^\prime \da d_\ua}} = T_\text{nonflip} - T_\text{flip}\\
\eeq
Assuming spin-half impurity, (\il{s=\hf})
\begin{gather}
T_\text{nonflip} =J\qq{m_d + \fr{J}{4}\cc{3(\alpha + \gamma) + 4m_d( \gamma - \alpha)}} \\
T_\text{flip} = J\qq{1 + J\rr{\gamma - \alpha}}
\end{gather}
Setting \il{m_d = -\hf},
\beq[tmatrix]
T_1 &= \fr{J}{2}\qq{1+\fr{J}{2}\rr{\alpha + 5 \gamma}}\\
T_0 &= -\fr{3J}{2}\qq{1-\fr{3J}{2}\rr{\alpha - \fr{\gamma}{3}}}
\eeq
The value of the prefactors can be understood as follows: The interaction term is 
\beq
J \vec S_d \cdot \vec \sigma_e = 2J \vec S_d \cdot \vec S_e = J \rr{S^2 - S_d^2 - S_e^2} = J \rr{s(s+1) - \fr{3}{2}} = \begin{cases} -\fr{3J}{2} &\text{(singlet)}\\ \fr{J}{2} &\text{(triplet)}\end{cases}
\eeq
Hence, the pre-factors are just the bare values of the interaction Hamiltonian, \il{V}.
Hence, the equations \ref{tmatrix} can be written as 
\beq
T = V(1 + TG)
\eeq
For the singlet and triplet \il{T-}matrices, it becomes
\beq[texp]
T_1 &= \fr{J}{2}\qq{1+T_1\rr{\alpha + 5 \gamma}} \implies T_1 = \fr{J/2}{1-\fr{J}{2}(\alpha + 5 \gamma)}\\
T_0 &= -\fr{3J}{2}\qq{1+T_0\rr{\alpha - \fr{\gamma}{3}}} \implies T_0 = \fr{-3J/2}{1+\fr{3J}{2}(\alpha - \gamma/3)}
\eeq
We want to find the maximum value of \il{|T_s|}.
To this end, rewrite
\begin{gather}
T_1 = \fr{1}{2/J - 5 \gamma - \alpha}\\
T_0 = \fr{1}{-2/3J + \gamma/2 - \alpha}
\end{gather}
For excitations \il{(k)} just above the Fermi surface, \il{\alpha} will encounter a zero in its denominator, because the integral in \il{\alpha} is outside the Fermi surface.
On the other hand, the integral in \il{\gamma} is inside the Fermi surface, so the denominator in \il{\gamma} will never become zero for \il{k} just outside the Fermi surface.
 Hence, \il{\alpha = \text{real part} - i\pi N(0), \gamma =\text{real part}}.
Accordingly, the expressions for \il{T_s} can be written as
\beq
T_s = \fr{1}{\text{real part} + i \pi N(0)}
\eeq
The maximum value of \il{|T_s|} will occur when the denominator is minimum, that is, when \il{\text{real part} = 0}.
Hence,
\beq
|T_s| \leq \fr{1}{\pi N_0}
\eeq
From eq.~\ref{tmatphase}, we can write
\beq
T_s = -\fr{e^{i \delta_s}\sin \delta_s}{\pi N(0)}
\eeq
Eq.~\ref{dsfromtmat} allows us to write
\beq
\rho_{d\sigma}(0) = -\fr{\text{Im}[T]}{t^2 \pi} = \fr{\sin^2 \delta_s}{t^2 \pi^2 N(0)} = \fr{\sin^2 \delta_s}{\pi \Delta} = \fr{1}{\pi \Delta}\sin^2 \rr{\fr{\pi n_c}{2}}
\eeq
where \il{n_c = \avg{n_{d\ua}+n_{d\da}}}.
This is in contrast to the value obtained from the mean field analysis of the Anderson model, eq,~\ref{rho},
\beq
\rho_{d\sigma}(0) = \fr{1}{\pi \Delta}\qq{1 + \rr{\fr{\epsilon_d + Un_c}{\Delta}}^{2}}^{-1}
\eeq
For \il{n_c =1} (half-filling), the mean field value is less than the one obtained from the spin-spin scattering.
This is because the mean-field analysis does not take these scatterings into account.
The large density of states at the Fermi level means that the spectral function has three peaks in general, two of which are revealed in the mean field analysis, but a third one exists, which is of a width of the order of a very low temperature \il{T_K}, and hence is not noticed at higher temperatures.\\\\
Eq.~\ref{texp} can be written as
\begin{gather}
T_1 = \fr{J/2}{1 - 2 J \gamma - \fr{J}{2}\rr{\alpha + \gamma}}\\
T_0 = \fr{-3J/2}{1 - 2 J \gamma + \fr{3J}{2}\rr{\alpha + \gamma}}
\end{gather}
Defining \il{J_\text{eff} = \fr{J}{1 - 2J\gamma}}, the scattering amplitudes \il{T_1} and \il{T_0} can be written as
\beq
T_1 = \fr{1}{\fr{2}{J_\text{eff}} - \rr{\alpha + \gamma}}\\
T_0 = \fr{-1}{\fr{2}{3J_\text{eff}}+\alpha + \gamma}
\eeq
\il{\alpha + \gamma} can be calculated as 
\beq
\alpha + \gamma &= \lim_{\eta \ra 0}\int_0^\infty d\epsilon \fr{N(\epsilon)}{\epsilon_k - \epsilon+ i\eta} \\
		&\sim\lim_{\epsilon_\text{up} \ra \infty} \ln \bigg\lvert \fr{\sqrt \epsilon_k - \sqrt{\epsilon_\text{up}}}{\sqrt \epsilon_k + \sqrt{\epsilon_\text{up}}}\bigg \rvert - i \pi N(0)
\eeq
In the limit of \il{\epsilon_\text{up} \ra \infty}, the argument of the \il{\log} becomes
\beq
\bigg\lvert \fr{\sqrt \epsilon_k - \sqrt{\epsilon_\text{up}}}{\sqrt \epsilon_k + \sqrt{\epsilon_\text{up}}}\bigg \rvert \approx \bigg\lvert \fr{- \sqrt{\epsilon_\text{up}}}{\sqrt{\epsilon_\text{up}}}\bigg \rvert = 1
\eeq
Hence, the real part vanishes, and the expression for \il{T_1} becomes
\beq
T_1 = \fr{1}{2J^{-1}_\text{eff} + i \pi N(0)} \sim \fr{1}{\fr{2}{\pi N(0)J_\text{eff}} + i}
\eeq
Since
\beq
T_s \sim e^{i \delta_s} \sin \delta_s = \fr{1}{\cot \delta_s - i}
\eeq
we can write
\beq
\cot \delta_1 = -\fr{2}{\pi N(0) J_\text{eff}}\implies \tan \delta_1 = -\fr{\pi}{2} N(0) J_\text{eff}
\eeq 
Similarly,
\beq
T_0 =  \fr{-1}{\fr{2}{3 J_\text{eff}} - i\pi N(0)} \sim \fr{-1}{\fr{2}{3 J_\text{eff} \pi N(0)} - i}
\eeq
giving
\beq
\cot \delta_0 = \fr{2}{3 J_\text{eff} \pi N(0)} \implies \tan \delta_0 = \fr{3\pi}{2} J_\text{eff} N(0)
\eeq
Since \il{J_\text{eff} > 0}, \il{\delta_1 < 0} and \il{\delta_0 > 0}.
The significance of this can be seen as follows.
For scattering at the Fermi surface, the scattered wavefunction can be written as
\beq
\psi \sim \psi_\text{in} - e^{2 i \delta_d} \psi_\text{out}
\eeq
where \il{\psi_\text{in} = \fr{e^{ik_F r}}{r}} is the incoming wave and \il{\psi_\text{out} = \fr{e^{-ik_F r}}{r}} is the outgoing one.
Hence,
\beq
\psi = \fr{e^{i \delta}}{r} \rr{e^{-i\rr{k_Fr + \delta_d}} - e^{i\rr{k_Fr + \delta_d}}} \sim \fr{e^{i \delta}}{r} \sin \qq{k_F\rr{r + \Delta r}}
\eeq
This scattered wave is thus another radial wave but its phase is shifted by an amount \il{\Delta r = \fr{\delta_d}{k_F}}.
For a positive \il{\Delta r} (and hence a positive \il{\delta_d}), the wave will be drawn inward.
Hence, the singlet channel having a positive \il{\delta} will lead to formation of bound states.
On the  other hand, the triplet channel has a negative phase shift, meaning it is repulsive.

\subsection{Adiabatic route to the Kondo resonance}\label{adiab}
Assuming \il{T=0}, the interactions due to a single impurity are unlikely to break adiabaticity.
Hence, we replace the effect of the \il{U} on the impurity by adding a self energy \il{\Sigma(\omega)} to the bare energy \il{\epsilon_d}.
This self energy can be Taylor-expanded about \il{E = 0}:
\beq
\Sigma(E) = \Sigma(0) + E\dv{\Sigma}{E}\bigg \vert_{E=0} + O(E^2)
\eeq
Defining 
\beq
Z^{-1} \equiv 1 - \dv{\Sigma}{E}\bigg \vert_{E=0}
\eeq
we can write
\beq[sigma]
\Sigma(E) = \Sigma(0) + \rr{1-Z^{-1}}E
\eeq
The interacting Green's function for the impurity becomes
\beq
G_f(E) &= \fr{1}{E - \epsilon_d - \Sigma - i\Delta}\\
\eeq
where \il{\Delta} is the result of the hybridisation.
Substituting eq.~\ref{sigma} and gathering the terms gives
\beq
G_f(E) = \fr{Z}{E - Z (\epsilon_d + \Sigma(0)) - iZ\Delta}
\eeq
Defining the renormalised parameters
\begin{gather}
\epsilon_d^* = Z (\epsilon_d + \Sigma(0))\\
\Delta^* = Z\Delta
\end{gather}
we have
\beq
G_f(E) = \fr{Z}{E - \epsilon_d^* - i \Delta^*}
\eeq
What this means is that as we adiabatically vary the interaction \il{U}, the parameters \il{\epsilon_d^*} and \il{\Delta^*} also morph, keeping the form of the Greens's function constant.
In the non-interacting limit (\il{U=0}), we have 
\beq
Z = 1, \Sigma = 0 \implies \epsilon_d^* = \epsilon_d, \Delta^* = \Delta
\eeq
We then recover the atomic form of the Green's function.
\il{Z} varies from 0 to 1.
\il{Z=1} is the non-interacting limit, \il{Z=0} is the limit of \il{U=\infty}.
The phase shift due to scattering can be calculated by looking at eq.\ref{phaseshift}, and replacing the bare quantities with the renormalised versions:
\beq[cotinv]
\delta_d(0) = \cot^{-1}\fr{\epsilon_d^*}{\Delta^*}
\eeq
Similarly, the renormalised version of eq.~\ref{densitys} is
\beq
\rho_d(0) = \fr{1}{\pi}\fr{\Delta^*}{{\epsilon_d^*}^2 + {\Delta^*}^2}
\eeq
Using eq.~\ref{cotinv} gives
\beq
\rho_d(0) = \fr{1}{\pi}\fr{\Delta^*}{{\Delta^*}^2\cot^2\delta_d + {\Delta^*}^2} = \fr{\sin^2 \delta_d}{\pi \Delta}
\eeq

\subsection{The Kondo temperature}
We consider a simplified model where a single conduction electron forms a singlet with the d-electron, and the rest of the conduction electrons simply fill the Fermi sea.
For the singlet state, \il{\vec S_e \cdot \vec S_d = -\fr{3}{2}}.
So,
\beq
H_K = \sum_{k > k_F} \epsilon_k n_k -\fr{3J}{2} \sum_{k,k^\prime > k_F} c^\dagger_{k^\prime \sigma}c_{k \sigma}
\eeq
The operator to create the singlet state \il{\ket{S_k} = \fr{1}{\sqrt 2}\rr{\ket{k\ua,d\da} - \ket{k\da,d\ua}}} off the Fermi sea (\il{\ket{\Phi}}) is
\beq
b_k^\dagger = \fr{1}{\sqrt 2}\rr{c^\dagger_{k \ua}c^\dagger_{d\da} - c^\dagger_{k \da}c^\dagger_{d\ua}}
\eeq
Hence the total wavefunction of singlet+Fermi-sea is
\beq
\ket{\Psi} = \sum_{k>k_F} a_k b_k^\dagger \ket{\Phi} = \ket{\Phi} \otimes \sum_{k > k_F}a_k \ket{S_k}
\eeq
\il{a_k} is the probability amplitude for the conduction electron in the single to have momentum \il{k}.
\beq[ak]
a_q = \bra{\Phi}\bra{S_q} \sum_k a_k \ket{S_k}\ket{\Phi} = \bra{\Phi}b_q\ket{\Psi}
\eeq
The Schrodinger equation for \il{\ket{\Psi}} is
\beq
E \ket{\Psi} = H_K \ket{\Psi} &= \ket{\Phi} \otimes H_k \sum_{k > k_F}a_k \ket{S_k}\\
			      &= \ket{\Phi} \otimes \sum_{k > k_F}a_k \rr{\epsilon_k \ket{S_k} -\fr{3J}{2}\sum_{k^\prime > k_F} \ket{S_{k^\prime}}}\\
			      &= \sum_{k>k_F} a_k \rr{\epsilon_k b^\dagger_k -\fr{3J}{2}\sum_{k^\prime > k_F}b^\dagger_{k^\prime}}\ket{\Phi}
\eeq
Multiplying \il{b_q} from left  gives
\beq
E b_q \ket{\Psi} = \epsilon_q a_q \ket{\Phi} - \fr{3J}{2}\sum_{k>k_F} a_k \ket{\Phi}
\eeq
Multiplying \il{\bra{\Phi}} from left and looking at eq.~\ref{ak} gives
\beq
E \bra{\Phi}b_q\ket{\Psi} = E a_q = a_q \epsilon_q - \fr{3J}{2}\sum_k a_k \\
\implies a_q = \fr{3J/2}{\epsilon_q - E}\sum_k a_k\\
\implies \sum_q a_q = \sum_q \fr{3J/2}{\epsilon_q - E}\sum_k a_k
\eeq
Since \il{\sum_q a_q =\sum_k a_k}, we get an equation for \il{E}
\beq
1 = \fr{3J}{2}\sum_{q>k_F} \fr{1}{\epsilon_q -E}
\eeq
Converting to integral,
\beq
1 = \fr{3J}{2}\int_{\epsilon_F}^D d\epsilon \fr{N(\epsilon)}{\epsilon -E}
\eeq
\il{D} is the upper limit of the conduction band.
Assuming \il{N(\epsilon)} is constant \il{(N(0))} in this range, we get
\beq
\fr{2}{3JN(0)} &= \ln \bigg \vert \fr{D-E}{\epsilon_F - E} \bigg\vert \approx \ln \bigg \vert \fr{D}{\epsilon_F - E}\bigg \vert\\
\implies E &= \epsilon_F - D e^{-\fr{2}{3N(0)J}}
\eeq
Thus, the energy of the ground state is lowered from the Fermi energy by an amount
\beq
E_b = D e^{-\fr{2}{3N(0)J}}
\eeq
The temperature below which this will be stable, \il{T_K}, is given by the relation
\beq[tk]
k_B T_k \sim E_b \implies T_K = \fr{D}{k_B}e^{-\fr{2}{3N(0)J}}
\eeq

\subsection{Poor man's scaling}
The idea is to reduce the bandwidth from \il{D} to \il{D - \delta D}, by considering all possible excitations in that range, up to second order.
The transition matrix second order contributions in that range
\beq
T^{(2)} = VG_0V
\eeq
can be clubbed into a term \il{\Delta V}.
This term is a representative of the scatterings from that range.
After reducing the bandwidth to \il{D -\delta D}, the effect of the excluded region can be incorporated by changing the interaction term \il{V \ra V^\prime = V + \Delta V}.
The interaction part is
\beq
H^\prime = J_z \sum_{k_1,k_2}S_d^z\rr{c^\dagger_{k_1\ua}c_{k_2\ua} - c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\da}} + J_T \sum_{k_1,k_2}\rr{S_d^+ c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\ua} + S_d^- c^\dagger_{k_1\ua}c_{k_2\da}}
\eeq
Incorporating \il{\Delta V} will involve changing the coupling constants \il{J_z} and \il{J_T}.
There are three types of scattering processes at second order:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item No spin-flip of impurity - involving \il{\rr{S_d^z}^2}
	\item one spin-flip of impurity - involving \il{S_d^z S_d^\pm} or \il{S_d^\pm S_d^z}
	\item two spin-flips of impurity - involving \il{S_d^\pm S_d^\mp}
\end{enumerate}

The first kind does not involve any spin impurity operator (\il{S_z^2 = \fr{1}{4}}), so it will be ignored.
The second kind will leave the impurity spin flipped at the end, and will hence result in a renormalization of \il{J_T}.
The third kind will leave the impurity spin unchanged (two flips), and hence will involve a renormalization of \il{J_z}.

\subsubsection{Renormalization of \il{J_z}}
First consider the process
\beq
k \ua, d\da \ra q \da d \ua \ra k^\prime \ua d\da
\eeq
The \il{T-}matrix term is
\beq
T_1 = J_T^2\sum_q S_d^- c^\dagger_{k^\prime \ua}c_{q\da}\fr{1}{E - H_0}S_d^+ c^\dagger_{q \da}c_{k\ua}
\eeq
Using eq.~\ref{identity}, we can write
\beq
(E - H_0)^{-1} c^\dagger_{q \da}c_{k\ua} = c^\dagger_{q \da}c_{k\ua}(E - \lambda -H_0)^{-1}
\eeq
where \il{\lambda} is given by \il{\qq{H_0,c^\dagger_{q \da}c_{k\ua}} = (\epsilon_q - \epsilon_k) c^\dagger_{q \da}c_{k\ua} \implies \lambda = \epsilon_q - \epsilon_k}.
Hence,
\beq
T_1 = J_T^2 S_d^- S_d^+ \sum_q c^\dagger_{k^\prime \ua}c_{q\da}c^\dagger_{q \da}c_{k\ua}\rr{E - \epsilon_q + \epsilon_k - H_0}^{-1}
\eeq
Since the upper momenta states are unoccupied, \il{c_{q\da}c^\dagger_{q \da} = 1 -n_q = 1}.
\beq
T_1 = J_T^2 S_d^- S_d^+ c^\dagger_{k^\prime \ua}c_{k\ua}\sum_q \rr{E - \epsilon_q + \epsilon_k - H_0}^{-1}
\eeq
If we set the Fermi level to 0, \il{H_0 = 0}.
Since the summation is over the narrow band \il{\{D - \delta D, D\}}, we can approximate the result of the summation as 
\beq
\sum_q \rr{E - \epsilon_q + \epsilon_k - H_0}^{-1} = N |\delta D | \fr{1}{E - D + \epsilon_k}
\eeq
\il{N} is the density of states.
Also,
\beq
S^- S^+= \rr{S^x - iS^y}\rr{S^x + iS^y} = \hf + i\qq{S^x,S^y} = \hf - S^z
\eeq 
Putting it all together, 
\beq
T_1 = J_T^2\rr{\hf - S_d^z}N|\delta D|c^\dagger_{k^\prime \ua}c_{k\ua}\fr{1}{E - D + \epsilon_k}
\eeq
For the second possible scattering,
\beq
q \da k \ua d\ua \ra k^\prime \ua k \ua d\da \ra k^\prime\ua q \da d\ua
\eeq
we get
\beq
T_2 = J_T^2\sum_q S_d^+S_d^- c^\dagger_{q\da}c_{k\ua}\fr{1}{E - H_0}c^\dagger_{k^\prime \ua}c_{q\da}
\eeq
Using \il{\qq{H_0, c^\dagger_{k^\prime \ua}c_{q\da}} = \rr{\epsilon_{k^\prime} - \epsilon_q} c^\dagger_{k^\prime \ua}c_{q\da}= \rr{\epsilon_{k^\prime} +D} c^\dagger_{k^\prime \ua}c_{q\da}}, and \il{S_d^+ S_d^- = \hf+S_d^z}, we get
\beq
T_2 &= J_T^2 \rr{\hf+S_d^z} N |\delta D|c_{k\ua}c^\dagger_{k^\prime \ua} \fr{1}{E - D - \epsilon_{k^\prime}} \\
	   &=-J_T^2 \rr{\hf+S_d^z} N |\delta D|c^\dagger_{k^\prime \ua} c_{k\ua}\fr{1}{E - D - \epsilon_{k^\prime}}
\eeq
The constant term resulting from the commutator at the last line was dropped.
For each of these two processes, there are identical processes that start with the conduction electron in \il{\da}:
\begin{gather}
k \da, d\ua \ra q \ua d \da \ra k^\prime \da d\ua\\
q \ua k \da d\da \ra k^\prime \da k \da d\ua \ra k^\prime\da q \ua d\da
\end{gather}
The only difference from the previous processes is that \il{S^+} is replaced by \il{S^-} and vice versa.
Hence, these  processes give
\begin{gather}
T_3 = J_T^2\rr{\hf + S_d^z}N|\delta D|c^\dagger_{k^\prime \da}c_{k\da}\fr{1}{E - D + \epsilon_k}\\
T_4 = -J_T^2 \rr{\hf-S_d^z} N |\delta D|c^\dagger_{k^\prime c_{k\da}\da} \fr{1}{E - D - \epsilon_{k^\prime}}
\end{gather}
The total second order contribution is
\beq
T^{(2)} &= -J_T^2 S_d^z N|\delta D|\rr{\fr{1}{E - D + \epsilon_k} + \fr{1}{E - D - \epsilon_{k^\prime}}}\rr{c^\dagger_{k^\prime \ua}c_{k\ua} - c^\dagger_{k^\prime \da}c_{k\da}}\\
\eeq
Comparing this with the \il{S_d^z} term in the Hamiltonian
\beq
J_z S_d^z\rr{c^\dagger_{k^\prime \ua}c_{k\ua} - c^\dagger_{k^\prime \da}c_{k\da}}\\
\eeq
we can easily write down the change in the coupling \il{J_d^z},
\beq
\delta J_d^z = -J_T^2 N|\delta D|\rr{\fr{1}{E - D + \epsilon_k} + \fr{1}{E - D - \epsilon_{k^\prime}}}
\eeq
For low energy excitations, we can neglect \il{E, \epsilon_k, \epsilon_{k^\prime}} with respect to \il{D}.
Noting that the bandwidth is decreasing and hence \il{\delta D < 0},
\beq
\dv{J_d^z}{D}=-J_T^2N \fr{2}{D}
\eeq
This is the scaling equation for the coupling \il{J_d^z}.

\subsubsection{Renormalization of \il{J_T}}
Consider the scattering
\beq
k \ua d\da \ra q\da d\ua \ra k^\prime \da d\ua
\eeq
\beq
T_1 = -J_T J_z S_d^z S_d^+N|\delta D|c^\dagger_{k^\prime \da}c_{k\ua}\fr{1}{E - D + \epsilon_k}
\eeq
The minus sign at the front comes from the term
\beq
-S_d^z c^\dagger_{k^\prime \da}c_{q\da}
\eeq
in the Hamiltonian.
Using \il{S_d^z S_d^+ = \fr{S_d^+}{2}},
\beq
T_1 = -J_T J_z \fr{S_d^+}{2} N|\delta D|c^\dagger_{k^\prime \da}c_{k\ua}\fr{1}{E - D + \epsilon_k}
\eeq
The second process is
\beq
q \ua k\ua d\da \ra k^\prime \da k \ua d\ua \ra q \ua k^\prime \da d\ua
\eeq
\beq
T_2 = -J_T J_z  \fr{S_d^+}{2}N |\delta D|c^\dagger_{k^\prime \da} c_{k\ua}\fr{1}{E - D - \epsilon_{k^\prime}}
\eeq
Two more processes can be constructed from the above two processes, by switching the \il{S_d^+} and \il{S_d^z} operations.
The change in the first process is that the \il{S_d^z} term will now become
\beq
+S_d^z c^\dagger_{k^\prime \ua}c_{q\ua}
\eeq
so that will invert the sign.
The change in the second process is that now the \il{q}-electron has to start off as \il{\da}, which means that the \il{S_d^z} term for this process becomes
\beq
-S_d^z c^\dagger_{k^\prime \da}c_{q\da}
\eeq
So the sign of the second process will also invert.
The change common to both the process is that \il{S_d^z S_d^+} becomes \il{ S_d^+S_d^z}.
Since  \il{ S_d^+S_d^z = -\fr{S_d^+}{2}}, this will involve a second change in sign for both processes.
Thus, overall there is no change for either proces.
\begin{gather}
T_3 = T_1\\
T_4 = T_2
\end{gather}
The total contribution is
\beq
T^{(2)} = -J_T J_z S_d^+ N |\delta D|c^\dagger_{k^\prime \da} c_{k\ua}\rr{\fr{1}{E - D - \epsilon_{k^\prime}} + \fr{1}{E - D + \epsilon_k}}
\eeq
Comparing with the \il{S_d^+} term in the Hamiltonian
\beq
J_T S_d^+ c^\dagger_{k^\prime \da} c_{k\ua}
\eeq
we can write
\beq
\delta J_T = -J_T J_z N |\delta D|\rr{\fr{1}{E - D - \epsilon_{k^\prime}} + \fr{1}{E - D + \epsilon_k}}
\eeq
Again neglecting the terms in the denominator, we get
\beq
\dv{J_T}{D} = -J_T J_z N\fr{2}{D}
\eeq
This is the scaling equation for \il{J_T}.

\subsubsection{Flow of the couplings}
Switching to the dimensionless couplings
\beq
g_1 = N J_z, g_2 = N J_T
\eeq
the equations become
\begin{gather}\label{ceq}
\dv{g_1}{D} = -\fr{2g_2^2}{D}\\
\dv{g_2}{D} = -\fr{2g_1g_2}{D}
\end{gather}
The first equation says that as the cutoff decreases, \il{g_1} will always increase.
For \il{g<0} (ferromagnetic coupling), the coupling will go to zero.
That is, at sufficiently low temperatures, the impurity electron becomes effectively decoupled from the conduction band.
The phenomenon is called asymptotic freedom.
For the antiferromagnetic case, the coupling should go to infinity.
This means that at sufficiently low temperatures, the coupling will necessarily become appreciable large so as to render perturbation theory inapplicable.
Dividing the two coupling equations gives
\beq
\dv{g_1}{g_2} = \fr{g_2}{g_1}\implies g_1^2 - g_2^2 = \text{constant}
\eeq
Taking \il{g_1} as the x-axis and \il{g_2} as the y-axis, depending on the sign of the constant, the solution is a vertical hyperbola or horizontal hyperbola.
Since the coupling equations are unchanged  under the transformation \il{g_2 \ra -g_2}, analyzing the upper half (\il{g_2 > 0}) suffices.
The antiferromagnetic case is easy.
\il{g_1 > 0} means \il{g_1} will always increase the RG flow.
The only solution is that both \il{g_1} and \il{g_2} flow to infinity.
For the ferromagnetic case, if \il{|g_1|>g_2}, \il{g_1} will increase and the representative point will reach the x-axis (\il{g_2 = 0}).
At this point, both the couplings will stop changing because both the derivatives involve \il{g_2}.
So the fixed point in this case is \il{g_2 = 0} and \il{g_1} is some negative value.
However, if \il{|g_1|<g_2}, the representative point will reach the positive y-axis.
Since \il{g_2 \neq 0} here, \il{g_1} will continue to grow and become positive at some point.
From there, it becomes the antiferromagnetic case.\\\\
Setting \il{g_1 = g_2 =g >0} and integrating either of the scaling equations gives
\beq[isot]
g(D^\prime) &= \fr{g_0}{1-2g_0\ln\fr{D}{D^\prime}} \\
\implies 2g(D^\prime) &= \fr{1}{\ln \fr{D^\prime}{T_K}}
\eeq
where \il{T_K = \fr{D}{k_B} \ex{-\fr{1}{2g_0}}}.
\il{D^\prime} is the running bandwidth and \il{D} is the original bandwidth.
This is almost the same as the one obtained in eq.~\ref{tk}, because \il{g = N J}.
The expression for \il{g_{D^\prime}} shows that perturbation theory will work only for \il{T \gg T_K}, because close to \il{T_K}, the expression becomes non-analytic.\\\\
The ferromagnetic case \il{(g<0)}, on the other hand, remains perturbative.
\beq
g(D^\prime) = \fr{g_0}{1-2g_0\ln\fr{D}{D^\prime}} = -\fr{|g_0|}{1+2|g_0|\ln\fr{D}{D^\prime}}
\eeq
At all points, the expression remains analytic, and gradually goes to zero at \il{D^\prime = 0}.

\subsubsection{Alternate way of obtaining the scaling equations}
From eq.~\ref{hamtmat}, the interaction part can be written as
\beq
\Delta H_{ll^\prime} = \hf\qq{T_{ll^\prime}(E_l) + T_{ll^\prime}(E_{l^\prime})}
\eeq
where the transition matrix \il{T} is
\beq
T_{ll^\prime}(E) = \sum_H \fr{V_{lH}V_{Hl^\prime}}{E - E_H}
\eeq
Here, \il{\{H\} = \{D-\delta D, D\}} and 
\beq
V = J \vec S_d \cdot \sum_{k,k^\prime,\alpha,\alpha^\prime} c^\dagger_{k \alpha} \vec \sigma_{\alpha \alpha^\prime} c_{k^\prime \alpha^\prime}
\eeq
The first process is 
\begin{gather}
	k \alpha \xrightarrow{\quad \sigma^b \quad} q \lambda \xrightarrow{\quad \sigma^a \quad} k^\prime \beta \\
	d \sigma \xrightarrow{\quad S_d^b \quad} d\sigma^{\prime\prime} \xrightarrow{\quad S_d^a \quad} d\sigma^\prime
\end{gather}
The transition matrix element is
\beq
T_1 &= \sum_{q\in\{D-\delta D\},\lambda,\sigma^{\prime\prime}}\bra{k^\prime\beta,\sigma^\prime}V\ket{q \lambda,\sigma^{\prime\prime}}\bra{q \lambda,\sigma^{\prime\prime}}V\ket{k\alpha,\sigma}\fr{1}{E-E_q}\\
    &= J^2\sum_{\sigma^{\prime\prime}}\rr{S_d^a}_{\sigma^\prime \sigma^{\prime\prime}}\rr{S_d^b}_{ \sigma^{\prime\prime}\sigma}\sum_\lambda \rr{\sigma^a}_{\beta \lambda} \rr{\sigma^b}_{\lambda\alpha}\sum_{q\in\{D-\delta D\}}\fr{1}{E-E_q}\\
    &\approx J^2\rr{ S_d^a S_d^b}_{ \sigma^{\prime}\sigma}\rr{\sigma^a \sigma^b}_{\beta \alpha} \fr{N |\delta D|}{E -D}
\eeq
The second process is
\begin{gather}
	k \alpha \xrightarrow{\quad \quad} k \alpha \xrightarrow{\quad \sigma^a \quad} q \lambda \\
q \lambda \xrightarrow{\quad \sigma^b \quad} k^\prime \beta \xrightarrow{\quad \quad} k^\prime \beta \\
	d \sigma \xrightarrow{\quad S_d^b \quad} d\sigma^{\prime\prime} \xrightarrow{\quad S_d^a \quad} d\sigma^\prime
\end{gather}
Here the intermediate state consists of two electrons with energy \il{E_k, E_{k^\prime}} and a hole with energy \il{-E_q}.
The transition matrix element is
\beq
T_2 &= \sum_{q\in\{D-|\delta D|\},\lambda,\sigma^{\prime\prime}}\bra{q \lambda,k^\prime\beta,\sigma^\prime}V\ket{k^\prime \beta,k \alpha,\sigma^{\prime\prime}}\bra{k^\prime \beta,k \alpha,\sigma^{\prime\prime}}V\ket{q\lambda,k\alpha,\sigma}\fr{1}{E-\rr{E_k + E_{k^\prime} - E_q}}\\
    &\approx -J^2\rr{ S_d^a S_d^b}_{ \sigma^{\prime}\sigma}\rr{\sigma^b\sigma^a }_{\beta \alpha} \fr{N |\delta D|}{E -D}
\eeq
Neglecting \il{E} with respect to \il{D} and adding the contributions, we get
\beq
T &= \fr{J^2 N |\delta D|}{D} \rr{S_d^a S_d^b}_{\sigma^{\prime}\sigma}\qq{\sigma^b,\sigma^a}_{\beta \alpha}\\
  &=\fr{J^2 N |\delta D|}{2D} \qq{S_d^a,S_d^b}_{\sigma^{\prime}\sigma}\qq{\sigma^b,\sigma^a}_{\beta \alpha}
\eeq
In the last step, I used \il{\cc{S^a,S^b}=0}.
Now,
\beq
\qq{S_d^a,S_d^b}_{\sigma^{\prime}\sigma}\qq{\sigma^b,\sigma^a}_{\beta \alpha} &= -\qq{S_d^a,S_d^b}_{\sigma^{\prime}\sigma}\qq{\sigma^a,\sigma^b}_{\beta \alpha}\\
&= -i\epsilon_{abc}S^c_{\sigma \sigma^\prime} 2 i \epsilon_{abd}\sigma^d_{\beta \alpha}\\
&=4\delta_{cd}S^c_{\sigma \sigma^\prime} \sigma^d_{\beta \alpha}\\
&=4\vec S_{\sigma \sigma^\prime} \cdot \vec \sigma_{\beta \alpha}
\eeq
Therefore,
\beq
T = \fr{2J^2 N |\delta D|}{D}\vec S_{\sigma \sigma^\prime} \cdot \vec \sigma_{\beta \alpha}
\eeq
The correction to the coupling \il{J} can be read off:
\beq
J(D - \delta D) = J(D) - \fr{2J^2 N \delta D}{D}
\eeq
This gives the same scaling equations we found earlier.

\subsection{Universality}
Adding a higher order correction to the Poor Man's scaling gives
\beq
\pd{g}{\ln D} = -2g^2 + 2g^3
\eeq
It can be integrated from \il{g^0(D)} to \il{g(D^\prime)}:
\beq
\ln \fr{D^\prime}{D} = -\int_{g_0}^g\fr{dg}{2g^2 - 2g^3} = -\int_{g_0}^g\fr{dg}{2g^2}\rr{1+g} \\
\eeq
Defining \il{D^\prime = k_B T_K} to be the temperature where \il{g \sim 1}, we can write
\beq
\ln \fr{k_B T_K}{D} = -\int_{g_0}^1\fr{dg}{2g^2}\rr{1+g} = -\fr{1}{2g_0} + \hf\ln g_0 + O(1)\\
=-\fr{1}{2g_0} + \hf\ln 2g_0 + O(1)
\eeq
This gives a better estimate of the Kondo temperature
\beq[sol]
T_K = \fr{D}{k_B} \sqrt{2g_0}\ex{-\fr{1}{2g_0}}
\eeq
\il{T_K} can also be determined by appealing to dimensional arguments and ideas of universality.
Since the energy scale in question is \il{D}, we can write
\beq[form]
k_B T_K = D y(g)
\eeq
where \il{y} is some dimensionless quantity.
Since \il{T_K} is a physical quantity, it cannot change with our choice of the bandwidth \il{D}:
\beq
\dv{T_K}{D}=0
\eeq
Substituting the form of \il{T_K}, eq.~\ref{form}, in this equation gives
\beq
y(g) + D\dv{y(g)}{D} = 0\\
\implies y + D\dv{y}{g}\dv{g}{D} = 0\\
\implies y -2g^2\dv{y}{g} = 0\\
\implies y = e^{-\fr{1}{2g}}
\eeq
This gives almost the same solution as eq.~\ref{sol}:
\beq
T_K = \fr{D}{k_B}e^{-\fr{1}{2g}}
\eeq
The difference in the pre-factor arises from the extra contribution incorporated in that solution.\\\\
The fact that the scaling equations are universal can be seen by noting that from eq.~\ref{isot}, up to second order, we can write
\beq
g(D^\prime) = g_0\rr{1 + 2g_0^2\ln\fr{D}{D^\prime}}
\eeq
As we lower the temperature, the quantum processes are able to be coherent and lower energies.
 At temperature \il{T}, the order of energies that is explored by the processes is \il{k_B T}.
Hence we can set \il{\fr{D}{D^\prime} =\fr{T}{T_F}}.
This says that the variation of the coupling from \il{g_0} to \il{g} is
\beq
g_0 \ra g = g_0\rr{1 + 2g_0 \ln \fr{T_F}{T}}
\eeq
Since \il{g \equiv N J}, we have recovered eq.~\ref{change}.
Since eq.~\ref{change} was obtained as a perturbation calculation, it should have been valid only at \il{T \gg T_K}, but the scaling relation holds at all temperatures.

\subsection{Method of pseudo-fermions}
Spin operators, unlike fermionic creation and annihilation operators,  do not satisfy Wick's theorem.
To remedy this, they can be factorised into fermionic operators.
For example,
\beq
S^z = \fr{\sigma^z}{2} = \sum_{ij} c^\dagger_i \fr{\sigma^z_{ij}}{2} c_j = \hf\rr{c^\dagger_\ua c_\ua - c^\dagger_\da c_\da}
\eeq
Similarly,
\beq
S^x = \hf\rr{c^\dagger_\ua c_\da + c^\dagger_\da c_\ua}\\
S^y = \fr{-i}{2}\rr{c^\dagger_\ua c_\da - c^\dagger_\da c_\ua}
\eeq
Now, the state \il{\ket{\ua}} can be represented as
\beq
\ket{\ua} = c^\dagger_\ua \ket{0}
\eeq
This however means that we get two other states in the Hilbert space, \il{\ket{0}} and \il{\ket{\ua\da}}, which are not allowed physically.
To remove them, we can do the following.
We can modify the Hamiltonian \il{H}, by introducing a complex chemical potential
\beq
\mu = -i\fr{\pi}{2}k_B T
\eeq
The new Hamiltonian is
\beq
\wl H = H -\mu (n_d - 1)
\eeq
The new partition function is then allowed to run over the entire Hilbert space, including the unphysical states.
The actual partition function for the original Hamiltonian \il{H} is
\beq
Z = \text{Tr}\qq{\ex{-\beta H}} = \sum_{\sigma_d = \ua,\da}\sum_{k}\qq{\ex{-\beta H}}
\eeq
The modified partition function is
\beq
\wl Z &= \text{Tr}\qq{\ex{-\beta \rr{H -  \mu(n_d-1)}}}\\
	     &=\text{Tr}\qq{\ex{-\beta H - i\fr{\pi}{2}(n_d -1)}}\\
	     &=\sum_{\sigma_d = \ua,\da}\sum_{k}\qq{\ex{-\beta H}} + \sum_{k}\ex{-\beta H + i\fr{\pi}{2}} + \sum_{k}\ex{-\beta H - i\fr{\pi}{2}}\\
	     &= Z\bigg\vert_{n_d = 1} + i Z\bigg\vert_{n_d = 0} - i Z\bigg\vert_{n_d = 0}
\eeq
Since the Hamiltonian involves the impurity electrons only as spin operators, and since \il{S_d(0) = 0 = S_d(\ua\da)}, we have 
\beq
Z\bigg\vert_{n_d = 0} = Z\bigg\vert_{n_d = 0}
\eeq
Hence,
\beq
\wl Z = Z
\eeq
Thus, we are able to retain the correct partition function because of the introduction of the complex chemical potential.\\\\
This method can also be used to determine the higher order corrections to the susceptibility.
The zeroth order diagrams are\\\\
\begin{figure}[tbh!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{poppov1.png} 
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{poppov2.png}
\end{figure}\\\\
The dotted lines are the impurity Greens function, so that diagram gives the impurity contribution to the susceptibility.
Similarly, the solid lines are the conduction electron Greens function.
The first diagram gives
\beq
\chi_c = -k_B T \sum_{k,\omega_n,\phi_0} \bra{\phi_0} \sigma^a G(k,i\omega_n)\sigma^bG_k(i\omega_n)\ket{\phi_0}
\eeq
The sum over the ground states \il{\ket{\phi_0}} constitutes a trace, so we can write it as
\beq
\chi_c &= -k_B T \sum_{k,\omega_n} \text{Tr}\qq{\sigma^a G(k,i\omega_n)\sigma^bG(k,i\omega_n)} \\
       &= -2 k_B T \sum_{k,\omega_n} G^2(k,i\omega_n)\\
       &= -2 k_B T \sum_{k,\omega_n} \rr{i\omega_n - \epsilon_k}^{-2}\\
       &= 2 \sum_k \dv{}{\epsilon_k}k_B T\sum_{\omega_n} \rr{i\omega_n - \epsilon_k}^{-1}
\eeq
Now, it can be shown that
\beq
k_B T\sum_{\omega_n} \rr{i\omega_n - \epsilon_k}^{-1} = f(\epsilon_k) - \hf
\eeq
where \il{f(\epsilon_k)} is the FD-distribution at \il{\epsilon_k}.
Therefore,
\beq
\chi_c &=2 \sum_k \dv{f(\epsilon_k)}{\epsilon_k}= 2\sum_k \rho(\epsilon_k) = 2 N(0)
\eeq
The second diagram gives
\beq
\chi_d^{(0)} = -k_B T \sum_{\omega_n} \text{Tr}\qq{\sigma^a G_d(i\omega_n)\sigma^bG_d(i\omega_n)} \\
\eeq
In the Popov-Fedotov scheme, we replace the impurity Greens function with
\beq
G_d = \frac{1}{i\omega_n - \lambda_d}
\eeq
where \il{\lambda_d = i\pi\fr{1}{2\beta}} is the imaginary chemical potential introduced.
Since this is, for mathematical purposes, the same as the conduction Greens function with \il{\lambda_d} replacing \il{\epsilon_k}, we again get
\beq
\chi^{(0)}_d &=2 \dv{f(\lambda_d)}{\lambda_d}= -2\beta\fr{e^{\beta \lambda_d}}{\rr{1+e^{\beta \lambda_d}}^2} = \beta
\eeq
The first order diagrams are
%\begin{center} \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{poppov3.png} \end{center}
%\begin{center} \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{poppov4.png} \end{center}
The first diagram gives
\beq
\chi^{(1)} = \chi_c \rr{-\fr{J}{2}} \chi_d = -\beta JN(0)
\eeq
The second one gives
\beq
\chi_d^{(1)} = \chi_d \rr{-\fr{J}{2}} \chi_c = -\beta JN(0)
\eeq
The total susceptibility is
\beq
\chi_d = \chi^{(0)}_d + \chi_d^{(1)} = \beta\rr{1 - 2 J N(0)}
\eeq
\subsection{Nozières' local Fermi liquid theory}
Wilson's numerical renormalization group calculation showed that the low temperature specific heat contribution from the singlet is linear in temperature
\beq
C_V = \gamma T
\eeq
This suggests that the strong-coupling limit of the Kondo model is a Fermi liquid.\\
The singlet state (\il{s=0}) has an energy
\beq
E_g = J\qq{2\vec S_e \cdot \vec S_d} = J\qq{S^2 - S_d^2 - S_e^2} = J\qq{s\rr{s+1} - \fr{3}{2}} = -\fr{3J}{2}
\eeq
Since the interaction term is spherically symmetric, it suffices to consider a one dimensional chain of conduction electrons with the impurity site coupling to the conduction electron at the origin.
This electron forms a singlet with the impurity electron,
\beq
\fr{\ket{0_\ua,d\da} - \ket{0_\da,d_\ua}}{\sqrt 2}
\eeq
Considering a tight-binding model, the only electron that can hop to the zeroth site is the one on the first site.
The hopping of this electron on to the zeroth site would lead to an energy of
\beq
E_1 = -\fr{3}{2}J + \fr{3}{2}J = 0
\eeq
because the new electron would have the spin opposite to the other electron on the \il{0^\text{th}} site.
This means that breaking the singlet raises the energy by \il{\fr{3}{2}J}.
At low temperatures and very large \il{J}, this is not possible.
That being said, there can always be virtual fluctuations into excited states.
For example, the impurity electron can tunnel into the conduction band (\il{n_d = 0}) or another conduction electron may scatter into the impurity site (\il{n_d = 2}).
Both these states have zero energy.
With further virtual excitations, it is also possible to go into the triplet state with energy \il{\fr{J}{2}}.
What this means is that although the singlet is stable with respect to energy-conserving transitions, the singlet is virtually polarizable, with the help of the site 1 electron.
This induces an interaction on the site 1.
Since the interaction on the site 1 is just a manifestation of the polarizability of the singlet, we can either take the singlet with its polarizability and assume the conduction band to be non-interacting, or we can assume the singlet to be static and take the Fermi sea to have a localised interaction at the site 1.
In the latter picture, we have a frozen singlet (which can be ignored) and an interacting Fermi sea.\\\\
The goal is to calculate the change in phase shift suffered by the conduction electrons in the presence of interactions.
In the absence of interactions, the scattered wavefunction is
\beq[shift]
\psi \sim \fr{\sin\qq{kr + \delta(E_k)}}{r}
\eeq
That is, the phase shift is only a function of the energy.
At the Fermi surface, this value \il{\delta(0)} is \il{\fr{\pi}{2}}, as known from the Friedel sum rule.
\beq
n = \sum_\sigma \fr{\delta}{\pi} \implies 1 = \fr{2\delta}{\pi} \implies \delta = \fr{\pi}{2}
\eeq
\il{n} is the number of conduction electrons bound in the resonance and the sum is over the possible quantum numbers (spin in this case).
\il{\delta(0)} can also be obtained directly from eq.~\ref{shift}, by substituting \il{k=k_F} and noting that the isolation of the 0\uu{th} site means all wavefunctions should shift by \il{\Delta r = a}:
\beq
k_F a = \delta(0) \implies \delta(0) = \fr{\pi}{2a} 2 = \fr{\pi}{2}
\eeq
where the formula for \il{k_F} was used.\\\\
In a Fermi gas, the energy levels are separated by
\beq
\Delta \epsilon = \pd{\epsilon}{k}\Delta k
\eeq
With the condition that the wavefunction should vanish at the boundary, we have \il{\Delta k = k_n - k_{n-1} = \fr{\pi}{L}}.
Hence,
\beq
\Delta \epsilon = \pd{\epsilon}{k}\fr{\pi}{L}
\eeq
However, this changes in the presence of the impurity.
Because of eq.~\ref{shift}, the boundary condition becomes
\beq
k_nL + \delta(\epsilon_k) = n\pi \implies k_n = \fr{n\pi}{L} - \fr{\delta}{L} = k_n^0 -\fr{\delta(\epsilon_k)}{L}
\eeq
The energy becomes
\beq
\epsilon(k) &= \epsilon(k^0) + \pd{\epsilon}{k}\rr{k - k_0}\\
	    &= \epsilon_k - \pd{\epsilon}{k}\fr{\delta(\epsilon_k)}{L}
\eeq
In the Landau formulation of an interacting Fermi liquid, the phase shifts will depend on the quasiparticle occupation probabilities \il{n_{k\sigma}}.
Hence,
\beq
\wl \epsilon_\sigma(k) = \epsilon_k - \pd{\epsilon}{k}\fr{\delta_\sigma(\epsilon_k,\{n_{q,\sigma}\})}{L}
\eeq
In bulk Fermi liquid, we expand the quasiparticle energy in the deviation of the quasiparticle distribution \il{n_k} from the ideal Fermi-Dirac distribution \il{n^0_k},
\beq[fliq]
\wl \epsilon_p = \underbrace{\epsilon_F}_{\text{Fermi gas}} &+ \overbrace{\fr{p_F^*}{m}\rr{p-p_F}}^{\text{linear contribution for \it{p} close to }p_F} \\
	    &+ \underbrace{\sum_{q\sigma}f(p,q)\rr{n_q - n^0_q}}_{\text{interacting between two quasiparticles at momenta \it{p} and \it{q}}}
\eeq
Similarly, for this local Fermi liquid, the phase shift depends on the energy of the quasiparticle \il{\wl \epsilon} and the quasiparticle occupation \il{n_{q\sigma}}.
Accordingly,
\beq
\delta_\sigma(\wl \epsilon,\{n_{q,\sigma}\}) = \delta_\sigma(\wl \epsilon = \epsilon_F, n_k = n^0_k) + \alpha\rr{\wl \epsilon - \epsilon_F} + \Phi \sum_{q\sigma^\prime}\rr{n_{q\sigma^\prime} - n^0_{q\sigma^\prime}}
\eeq
This is just a Taylor expansion of \il{\delta_\sigma} around \il{\tilde \epsilon = \epsilon_F} and \il{n_q = n^0_q}.
\il{\Phi} and \il{\alpha} play the same role as \il{f} and \il{\fr{p_F^*}{m}} in eq.~\ref{fliq}.
Specifically, \il{\Phi} represents the onsite interaction between quasiparticles of  opposite spin and 
\beq
\alpha = \dv{\delta_\sigma}{E}
\eeq
Since \il{\Phi} acts only between quasiparticles of opposite spin, the last term can be simplified by requiring \il{\sigma^\prime = -\sigma},

\beq[phases]
\delta_\sigma(\wl \epsilon,\{n_{q,\sigma}\}) = \delta_\sigma(\wl \epsilon = \epsilon_F, n_k = n^0_k) + \alpha\rr{\wl \epsilon - \epsilon_F} + \Phi \sum_{q}\delta n_{q,-\sigma}
\eeq
Since the singlet is isolated from the Fermi liquid, any change in the chemical potential will not affect the average occupation of the impurity site \il{\avg{n_d}}, and since we know that \il{\avg{n_d} = \fr{2\delta(0)}{\pi}}, this means that \il{\delta(0)}, the phase shift at the Fermi surface, is invariant under a change of the chemical potential.
This in turn means that the resonance scattering (\il{\delta = \fr{\pi}{2}}) will always be pinned to the Fermi surface.
With this knowledge, let us explicitly try to calculate the change in the phase shift at Fermi surface when we change the chemical potential by \il{\Delta \mu}.
Before the change in chemical potential,
\beq
\delta^0_\ua = \fr{\pi}{2} + \Phi\sum_q \delta n^0_{q\da}
\eeq
Since \il{\delta n^0 = n^0 - n^0 =0},
\beq
\delta^0_\ua = \fr{\pi}{2}
\eeq
After the change in chemical potential, \il{\epsilon_F^\prime = \epsilon_F + \Delta \mu} and 
\begin{gather}
N(\mu = 0) = N^0 \\
N(E^\prime = E+\mu) = N(E^\prime = E) + \dv{N}{E^\prime}\rr{E^\prime - E} = N^0 + \rho \Delta \mu\\
\implies \sum_q \delta n_q = N - N^0 = \rho \Delta \mu
\end{gather}
Hence, from eq.~\ref{phases},
\beq
\delta_\ua &= \fr{\pi}{2} + \alpha\rr{\epsilon_F^\prime - \epsilon_F} + \Phi\sum_q \delta n_{q\da}\\
	   &= \delta^0_\ua + \alpha\Delta\mu + \Phi \rho \Delta \mu
\eeq
Hence the change in the phase is
\beq
0 = \Delta \delta_\ua = \Delta \mu\rr{\alpha + \Phi \rho} \implies \alpha = -\Phi\rho
\eeq\\\\
This shows that the interaction term \il{\Phi} is responsible for pinning the resonance at the Fermi level; without that term in the formalism, the occupancy of the impurity site will change.
This is similar to the fact that the interaction term \il{f(k,k^\prime)} in the bulk Fermi liquid is responsible for making the Landau theory invariant under Galilean transformations.\\\\
Now we can calculate the density of states.
From the boundary condition, we have
\beq
n_\sigma = \fr{kL}{\pi} + \fr{\delta_\sigma(E)}{\pi} = n^0 + \fr{\delta_\sigma(E)}{\pi}
\eeq
Hence,
\beq
\rho &= \dv{n_\sigma}{E} = \rho^0 + \fr{1}{\pi}\dv{\delta_\sigma}{E} \\
\implies \rho&=\rho^0 + \fr{1}{\pi}\alpha
\eeq
\il{\rho^0} is the density of states in absence of the impurity.
The low temperature specific heat of an ideal Fermi liquid can be shown to be
\beq
C_v^0 = \gamma T = \fr{\pi^2 k_B^2}{3} \mathcal{N}(0) T
\eeq
The interacting Fermi liquid is just a renormalised version of the Fermi gas, with a modified density of states \il{\fr{1}{\pi}\alpha}.
Hence, the impurity contribution to the specific heat is
\beq
C_v &= \fr{\pi^2 k_B^2}{3}\rr{\rho_\ua + \rho_\da} T\\
    &=\fr{2\alpha}{\pi} \fr{\pi^2 k_B^2}{3} T
\eeq
In presence of a magnetic field \il{B}, the magnetization is 
\beq
m = \delta n \times \mu
\eeq
where \il{\mu} is the magnetic moment
\beq
\mu = -\fr{g}{2}\mu_B 
\eeq
and \il{\delta n} is the difference in number between up and down electrons
\beq
\delta n = \avg{n_\ua} - \avg{n_\da} = \fr{1}{\pi}\rr{\delta_\ua - \delta_\da}
\eeq
In the presence of the magnetic field, all energies get modified,
\beq
E^B_\sigma = E - \sigma \fr{g\mu_B}{2}B
\eeq
Hence,
\beq
\sum_k \delta n_{k\sigma} = N_\sigma(E^B_\sigma) - N(E) = \dv{N}{E^B}\rr{E^B - E} = -\rho \fr{g \mu_B}{2}\sigma B
\eeq
This modifies the phase shift at the Fermi surface,
\beq
\delta_\sigma(\epsilon_F) &= \fr{\pi}{2} + \alpha\rr{\epsilon_F - \fr{g \mu_B}{2}\sigma B - \epsilon_F} + \Phi\sum_q \delta n_{q,-\sigma}\\
			  &= \fr{\pi}{2} - \sigma \fr{g \mu_B}{2}\alpha B + \Phi \rho \fr{g \mu_B}{2}\sigma B\\
			  &= \fr{\pi}{2} - 2\alpha\fr{g \mu_B}{2}\sigma B
\eeq
Hence,
\beq
\delta n = \fr{1}{\pi}\rr{\delta_\ua - \delta_\da} = -\fr{4\alpha B}{\pi}\fr{g \mu_B}{2}
\eeq
The susceptibility is
\beq
\chi = \pd{m}{B} = \pd{}{B}\mu\delta n = \fr{4\alpha}{\pi}\rr{\fr{g \mu_B}{2}}^2
\eeq

The susceptibility for an ideal Fermi gas can be calculated similarly.
The additional energy of an electron with spin \il{\sigma} in a magnetic field \il{B} is \il{-\sigma \fr{g}{2}\mu_B B}.
The magnetization induced at the Fermi surface is \il{\delta n \times \mu}, where \il{\mu} is the magnetic moment
\beq
\mu = -\fr{g}{2}\mu_B 
\eeq
and \il{\delta n} is the difference in number between up and down electrons
\beq
\delta n = n_\ua(0) - n_\da(0) = n_\ua(\epsilon_F - \fr{g}{2}\mu_B B) - n_\da(\epsilon_F + \fr{g}{2}\mu_B B) = -\hf\mathcal{N}(0)gB \mu_B
\eeq
\il{\mathcal{N}(0) = \pd{n}{E}\bigg |_{\epsilon_F}} is the density of states at the Fermi energy and the \il{\hf} is because we are counting electrons of a particular spin only.
Therefore,
\beq
m = \delta n \times \mu = \mathcal{N}(0)\rr{\fr{g}{2} \mu_B}^2B
\eeq
The magnetic susceptibility comes out to be 
\beq
\chi^0 = \pd{m}{B}\bigg |_{B \ra 0} = \mathcal{N}(0)\rr{\fr{g}{2} \mu_B}^2
\eeq
The Wilson ratio \il{R} can now be computed,
\beq
R = \frac{\chi/\chi_0}{C_v/C_v^0} = \frac{4\alpha/\pi\mathcal{N}(0)}{2\alpha/\pi\mathcal{N}(0)} = 2
\eeq

\subsection{Numerical renormalization group calculation}
Wilson's idea wanted to remove the limitations of the perturbative nature of Anderson's scaling method.
To that end, we transformed the Hamiltonian into a one-dimensional chain, and then iteratively diagonalised chains of increasing length.
The Hamiltonian we are working with is
\beq
H = \sum_k \epsilon_k n_k + J \vec S_d \cdot \vec \sigma_e
\eeq
where \il{\vec \sigma_e = \sum_{k_1,k_2,\alpha\beta}c^\dagger_{k_1\alpha}\vec \sigma_{\alpha\beta}c_{k_2,\beta}} is the conduction electron spin at the origin.
This assumes that the exchange interaction \il{J(k,k^\prime} is independent of spin.
To form the linear chain, we construct a new basis in which to express the conduction electron part \il{H_c}, out of the states \il{\ket{0},H_c\ket{0},H_c^2\ket{0},...}.
\il{\ket{0}} is the origin site, where the impurity resides.
The first member of the new basis is \il{\ket{0}}.
The next member is taken to be some state in the subspace of \il{\ket{0}} and \il{H_c\ket{0}},
\beq
\ket{1} = \rr{\lambda_1 H_c\ket{0} + \lambda_2\ket{0}}
\eeq
This is a general form for any ket in the subspace spanned by \il{\ket{0}} and \il{H_c\ket{0}}.
Since we want the state to be normalised , we can shift one of the parameters to the denominator:
\beq
\ket{1} = \fr{1}{\gamma_0}\rr{H_c\ket{0} + \lambda\ket{0}}
\eeq
where \il{\gamma_0} sets \il{\avg{1|1} = 1}.
The remaining parameter is set by requiring \il{\avg{1|0} = 0}.
That gives
\beq
\lambda = -\avg{0|H_c|0}
\eeq
Therefore,
\beq
\ket{1} = \fr{1}{\gamma_0}\rr{H_c\ket{0} -\avg{0|H_c|0}\ket{0}}
\eeq
The general state can be shown to be
\beq[chain]
\ket{n+1} = \fr{1}{\gamma_n}\rr{H_c \ket{n} - \ket{n}\avg{n|H_c|n-1}-\ket{n-1}\avg{n-1|H_c|n}}
\eeq
From eq.~\ref{chain}, by multiplying \il{\bra{n^\prime}} from left, we get
\beq
\delta_{n^\prime,n+1} = \fr{1}{\gamma_n}\qq{\rr{H_c}_{n^\prime,n} + \rr{H_c}_{n,n-1}\delta_{n^\prime,n} + \rr{H_c}_{n-1,n}\delta_{n^\prime,n-1}}
\eeq
Clearly, for \il{n^\prime < n-1} or \il{n^\prime > n+1}, we get
\beq
\rr{H_c}_{n^\prime,n} = 0
\eeq
so the only non-zero terms are for \il{n^\prime = n-1,n,n+1}.
For \il{n^\prime = n+1} gives
\beq
\rr{H_c}_{n+1,n} = \gamma_n
\eeq
Taking the complex conjugate of this gives
\beq
\gamma_n^* = \rr{H_c^\dagger}_{n,n+1} = \rr{H_c}_{n,n+1}
\eeq
Defining 
\beq
\rr{H_c}_{n,n} = \epsilon_n
\eeq
we can write
\beq
H_c &= \sum_{n_1,n_2} \ket{n_1}\bra{n_1} H_c \ket{n_2}\bra{n_2}\\
    &= \sum_{n}\epsilon_n \ket{n}\bra{n} + \sum_{n}\rr{\gamma_n\ket{n} \bra{n+1}+ \gamma^*_n\ket{n+1} \bra{n}}\\
    &= \sum_{n}\epsilon_n \hat n_n + \sum_{n}\rr{\gamma_nc^\dagger_n c_{n+1}+ \gamma^*_nc^\dagger_{n+1} c_{n}}
\eeq
The diagonalization of these chains become impossible for \il{n>8}.
To remedy this problem, Wilson, after diagonalization a chain of a particular length, retained only the lowest parts of the spectrum, and the Hamiltonian for the next stage was formed out of these low-lying states.
This keeps the size of the Hilber space (and hence the matrices) manageable.
Another problem is that as one goes on adding sites to the chain, the couplings need to die off, otherwise this process will never converge.

\subsubsection{Logarithmic discretization}
First, note that up to first order
\beq
\epsilon_k = \epsilon_F + (k-k_F)\pd{\epsilon_k}{k}
\eeq
By choosing \il{k_F = \epsilon_F = 0}, we get \il{\epsilon_k = k}.\\\\
Wilson divided the conduction band into patches, \il{[\Lambda^{-(n+1)},\Lambda^{-n}]}, for \il{n=1,2,3..}.
The width of each interval is
\beq
d_n = \Lambda^{-n}\rr{1-\Lambda^{-1}}
\eeq
We can now define orthogonal functions in this \il{n^\text{th}} interval \il{k \in [\Lambda^{-(n+1)},\Lambda^{-n}]},
\beq
\psi_{m,n}(k) = \fr{1}{\sqrt{d_n}} \ex{\fr{2\pi i m}{d_n} k}
\eeq
They allows us to define a new set of creation operators,
\beq
a^\dagger_{m,n} = \sum_k \psi_m(k)c^\dagger_k
\eeq
Similarly functions can be defined in the negative interval \il{-k \in[\Lambda^{-(n+1)},\Lambda^{-n}]}.
\begin{gather}
	\phi_{m,n}(k) = \fr{1}{\sqrt{d_n}} \ex{-\fr{2\pi i m}{d_n} k}\\
	b^\dagger_{m,n} = \sum_k \phi_m(k)c^\dagger_k
\end{gather}
Then,
\beq
a^\dagger_{m,n} + b^\dagger_{m,n} = \fr{2}{\sqrt{d_n}}\sum_{\pm k \in []} \cos \rr{\fr{2\pi mk}{d_n}} c^\dagger_k
\eeq
Summing over \il{n} involves summing over all momenta.
\beq[zerom]
\sum_n \rr{a^\dagger_{m,n} + b^\dagger_{m,n}} &= \fr{2}{\sqrt{d_n}}\sum_{k} \cos \rr{\fr{2\pi mk}{d_n}} c^\dagger_k\\
\implies \sum_n \rr{a^\dagger_{0,n} + b^\dagger_{0,n}} &= \fr{2}{\sqrt{d_n}}\sum_{k} c^\dagger_k\\
\eeq
For the momentum-independent \il{J(k,k^\prime)}, the coupling term involves.
\beq
\sum_{k,q}c^\dagger_k c_q = \sum_{k}c^\dagger_k \sum_{q}c_q
\eeq
Looking at eq.~\ref{zerom}, we see that the impurity spin is coupled only to the \il{m=0} operators.
This is where the approximation comes in, in Wilson's scheme.
All the \il{m} values other than \il{m=0} are ignored.\\\\
Wilson chose
\beq
\epsilon_n = 0, \gamma = D^\prime \Lambda^\fr{-n}{2}
\eeq
with \il{\Lambda>1}.
The Hamiltonian for \il{N} sites then turns out to be
\beq[run]
H_N = D^\prime \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \Lambda^{-\fr{n}{2}}\rr{c^\dagger_n c_{n+1}+c^\dagger_{n+1} c_{n}} + 2 J \vec S_d \cdot \vec S_e
\eeq
The next step involves adding another site to the chain.
The next Hamiltonian is hence
\beq
H_{N+1} = H_N + D^\prime \Lambda^{-\fr{N}{2}}\rr{c^\dagger_N c_{N+1}+c^\dagger_{N+1} c_{N}}
\eeq
To compare the couplings, and hence the Hamiltonians, at each value of \il{N}, we need to rescale the Hamiltonians \il{H_N} so that the lowest energy scale is independent of the running index \il{N}.
Looking at eq.~\ref{run}, the lowest energy scale is \il{\Gamma_N = D^\prime \Lambda^{-\fr{N-1}{2}}}.
Hence, the rescaled Hamiltonian is
\beq
\ol H_N = \frac{H_N}{\Gamma_N} = \fr{\Lambda^{\fr{N-1}{2}}}{D^\prime} H_N
\eeq
The utility can be seen by noting the relation between \il{\ol H_{N+1}} and \il{\ol H_N},
\beq[rec]
\ol H_{N+1} &= \fr{\Lambda^{\fr{N}{2}}}{D^\prime}\qq{H_N + \Lambda^{\fr{-N}{2}}D^\prime\rr{c^\dagger_N c_{N+1}+c^\dagger_{N+1} c_{N}}}\\
\implies \ol H_{N+1} &= \Lambda^\hf\ol H_N + \rr{c^\dagger_N c_{N+1}+c^\dagger_{N+1} c_{N}}
\eeq
In the series of Hamiltonians \il{\{H_N\}}, the couplings to the extra site are all same, so the lowest energy scales are all of the same order.
This allows us to construct a flow of the Hamiltonians.
The real Hamiltonian is the unscaled one, so it is given by
\beq
H = \lim_{N \ra \infty} H_N = \lim_{N \ra \infty} D^\prime \Lambda^\fr{1-N}{2} \ol H_N
\eeq
Since \il{\ol H_N} is exactly diagonalised with a spectrum \il{\{E_m,\ket{m}\}}, it can be written down as
\beq
\ol H_N = \sum_m E_m \ket{m}\bra{m}
\eeq
The next Hamiltonian is then
\beq
\ol H_{N+1} = \Lambda^\hf \sum_m E_m \ket{m}\bra{m} + \sum_{m.m^\prime}\rr{ C(m,m^\prime) \ket{m}\bra{m^\prime} + \text{h.c.}}
\eeq
This is the same equation as eq.~\ref{rec}, with \il{\ol H_N} expressed in its eigenbasis and the creation and annihilation operators also expressed in that basis; the \il{C(m,m^\prime)} are just the matrix elements of \il{c} and \il{c^\dagger} in that basis.\\\\
To check whether the guesses about the fixed points are true, Wilson did the following.
He set \il{J=0.009} and then then calculated the lowest excitations of the Hamiltonians obtained from the NRG in the limit of large \il{N}.
They indeed correspond to the excitations of the Kondo hamiltonian at \il{J = \infty}, meaning that under the application of the NRG, the \il{J=0.009} Hamiltonian flowed to the fixed-point Hamiltonian \il{J = \infty}.

\pagebreak
\subsection{Correspondence between the Kondo model fixed-point and a local Fermi liquid - Topological interpretation of Wilson ratio}
\subsubsection{Local Fermi liquid}
The fixed-point Hamiltonians are found to represent interacting Fermi liquids.
The effective Hamiltonian can be shown to resemble the Anderson model, but with modified parameters,
\beq
H_\text{eff} = \sum_k \epsilon_k n_k + \sum_k{V_k c^\dagger_d c_k + \text{h.c.}} + U n_{d\ua}n_{d\da}
\eeq
The parameters \il{\epsilon_k,V_k,U} are not the same as the Anderson model we start with, but I am using the same symbols for convenience.
The interaction term \il{U} is the leading irrelevant operator near the low-energy fixed point.
For \il{T \ra 0}, assuming only single excitations, the interacting term will not get invoked.\\\\
Under mean-field,
\beq
n_{d\ua}n_{d\da} &\approx n_{d\ua}\avg{n_{d\da}} + \avg{n_{d\ua}}n_{d\da} - \avg{n_{d\ua}}\avg{n_{d\da}}\\
\implies \avg{n_{d\ua}n_{d\da}} &= \avg{n_{d\ua}}\avg{n_{d\da}}\\
				&= \sum_{k,q}\avg{n_{k\sigma}} \avg{n_{q,-\sigma}}\\
\eeq
where \il{N} is the number of sites.
Note that the number of excitations, \il{\avg{n_q}} has to be defined differently for the states above and below the Fermi surface.
For excited states above \il{\epsilon_F}, the number of excitations is given usually:
\beq
\avg{n_q^>} = \bra{\psi^>}c^\dagger_k c_k\ket{\psi^>} = n^p_k
\eeq
where \il{n^p_k} stands for the number of particles.
For states below \il{\epsilon_F}, however, we need to count the number of holes:
\beq
\avg{n_q^<} = \bra{\psi^<}c^\dagger_k c_k\ket{\psi^<} = -\bra{\psi^<}c_k c^\dagger_k \ket{\psi^<} = -n^h_k
\eeq
where \il{n^h_k} stands for the number of holes.
We can thus define a generalized excitation:
\beq
\avg{\delta n_{k,\sigma}} = \begin{cases} n^p_k, &\epsilon_k > \epsilon_F\\ -n^h_k, &\epsilon_k < \epsilon_F\end{cases}
\eeq
Replacing the quasiparticle excitations with their expectation values, the effective one-particle energy becomes
\beq
\epsilon_{k\sigma} = \epsilon_k + U\sum_q \avg{\delta n_{q,-\sigma}} \equiv \epsilon_k + U\avg{\delta n_{-\sigma}}
\eeq
This is analogous to the Landau quasiparticle energy functional, eq.~\ref{temp_en}, \il{U} acting as the interaction between the quasiparticles.
\il{\delta n > 0} acts as the excitations from the ground state.
\pb
The interacting density of states is
\beq[dosint]
\rho_{d\sigma}(\omega) = \fr{\Delta}{\pi}\fr{1}{\rr{\omega - \epsilon_d^*}^2 + \Delta^2}
\eeq
where \il{\epsilon_d^* = \epsilon_d + U\avg{\delta n_{-\sigma}}}.

\subsubsection{Calculation of \il{C_v}}
To calculate the specific heat, \il{C_v = \dv{\avg{E}}{T}}, note that a change in temperature would modify the quasiparticle distribution \il{\delta n_{k\sigma}} and hence the quasiparticle energies \il{\epsilon_{k\sigma}}.
This leads to a complicated feedback effect.
However, at low temperatures, higher order excitations will be very low and we can approximate by considering only the variation in the distribution:
\beq
\dv{\avg{E}}{T} &= \sum_{k,\sigma}\epsilon_{k\sigma}\dv{\avg{\delta n_{k\sigma}}}{T}\\
\eeq
%\beq
%\dv{\avg{E}}{T} &= \dv{}{T}\sum_{k,\sigma}\epsilon_{k\sigma}\avg{\delta n_{k\sigma}}\\
%		&= \sum_{k,q,\sigma}\dv{}{T}\rr{\epsilon_{k}\avg{\delta n_{k\sigma}} + U\avg{\delta n_{q,-\sigma}}\avg{\delta n_{k\sigma}}}\\
%		&= \sum_{k,q,\sigma}\rr{\epsilon_{k}\dv{\avg{\delta n_{k\sigma}}}{T} + U\dv{\avg{\delta n_{q,-\sigma}}}{T}\avg{\delta n_{k\sigma}} + U\avg{\delta n_{q,-\sigma}}\dv{\avg{\delta n_{k\sigma}}}{T}}\\
%		&=\sum_{k,q,\sigma}\rr{\epsilon_{k}\dv{\avg{\delta n_{k\sigma}}}{T} + 2U\avg{\delta n_{q,-\sigma}}\dv{\avg{\delta n_{k\sigma}}}{T}}\\
%		&=\sum_{k,q,\sigma}\rr{2\epsilon_{k\sigma} - \epsilon_k}\dv{\avg{\delta n_{k\sigma}}}{T}
%\eeq
Since the quasiparticle excitations are adiabatically connected to the free electron excitations, \il{\avg{\delta n_{k\sigma}}} will follow a Fermi-Dirac distribution:
\beq
\avg{\delta n_{k\sigma}}(T) &= \fr{1}{e^{\beta\epsilon_{k\sigma}} + 1}\\
\implies \dv{\avg{\delta n_{k\sigma}}}{T} &= \fr{e^{\beta\epsilon_{k\sigma}}}{\rr{e^{\beta\epsilon_{k\sigma}} + 1}^2}\qq{\fr{1}{k_B T^2}\epsilon_{k\sigma} -\fr{1}{k_B T}\rr{2\epsilon_{k\sigma} - \epsilon_k}\dv{\avg{\delta n_{k\sigma}}}{T}}
\eeq
At sufficiently low temperatures, the first term will dominate over the others (\il{T^{-2} \gg T^{-1}}).
Hence the low temperature specific heat can be written as
\beq
\dv{\avg{E}}{T} &= \sum_{k,\sigma}\epsilon_{k\sigma}\fr{e^{\beta\epsilon_{k\sigma}}}{\rr{e^{\beta\epsilon_{k\sigma}} + 1}^2}\fr{1}{k_B T^2}\epsilon_{k\sigma}\\
		&= \fr{1}{k_B T^2}\sum_{k,\sigma}\epsilon_{k\sigma}^2\fr{e^{\beta\epsilon_{k\sigma}}}{\rr{e^{\beta\epsilon_{k\sigma}} + 1}^2}\\
		&=\fr{1}{k_B T^2}\sum_{\sigma}\int d\epsilon_\sigma \rho(\epsilon_\sigma) \epsilon_{\sigma}^2\fr{e^{\beta\epsilon_{k\sigma}}}{\rr{e^{\beta\epsilon_{k\sigma}} + 1}^2}
\eeq
The function \il{\fr{e^{\beta\epsilon_{k\sigma}}}{\rr{e^{\beta\epsilon_{k\sigma}} + 1}^2}} is very sharply peaked at the Fermi surface \il{\epsilon_\sigma = 0}.
Therefore we can replace the density of states by its value at the Fermi surface.
\beq
\dv{\avg{E}}{T} &=\fr{1}{k_B T^2}\sum_{\sigma}\rho_\sigma(0) \int_{-\infty}^\infty d\epsilon_\sigma\epsilon_{\sigma}^2\fr{e^{\beta\epsilon_{k\sigma}}}{\rr{e^{\beta\epsilon_{k\sigma}} + 1}^2}\\
		&=-\fr{1}{T}\sum_{\sigma}\rho_\sigma(0) \int_{-\infty}^\infty  d\epsilon_\sigma \epsilon_{\sigma}^2f^\prime(\epsilon_\sigma)\\
		&=-\fr{1}{T}\sum_{\sigma}\rho_\sigma(0) \int_1^0 df \epsilon_{\sigma}^2
\eeq
\il{f(\epsilon_\sigma)} is the Fermi-Dirac distribution.
Note that
\beq
\epsilon = k_B T\ln \rr{f^{-1} - 1}\implies \epsilon^2 =k_B^2 T^2\qq{\ln \rr{f^{-1} - 1}}^2
\eeq
Therfore,
\beq
\dv{\avg{E}}{T} &=-k_B^2 T\sum_{\sigma}\rho_\sigma(0) \int_1^0 df \qq{\ln \rr{f^{-1} - 1}}^2
\eeq
The remaining integral gives \il{-\fr{\pi^2}{3}}.
For \il{T \ra 0}, quasiparticle excitations will be absent and we can write \il{\rho_\ua = \rho_\da = \rho_d}:
\beq
\dv{\avg{E}}{T} &=k_B^2 T\sum_{\sigma}\rho_d(0) \fr{\pi^2}{3}\\
		&=2k_B^2 T\rho_d(0) \fr{\pi^2}{3}\\
		&= \gamma_\text{imp}T
\eeq
where
\beq
\gamma_\text{imp} \equiv \fr{C_v}{T} = \fr{2\pi^2}{3}k_B^2\rho_d(0) 
\eeq
This is identical in structure to the Fermi gas result \il{C_v^{(0)} \equiv \gamma^{(0)} T = \fr{2\pi^2}{3}k_B^2\rho^{(0)}_d(0) T}:
\beq
\fr{\gamma_\text{imp}}{\gamma^{(0)}} = \fr{\rho_d(0)}{\rho^{(0)}_d(0)}
\eeq
\subsubsection{Calculation of \il{\chi}}
Under a magnetic field \il{B}, \il{ \epsilon_{k\sigma} \ra \epsilon_{k\sigma} + \sigma h}.
where \il{h=\hf g B \mu_B}.
The magnetisation is
\beq
m &= \fr{g\mu_B}{2}\rr{\delta n_\ua - \delta n_\da}\\
  &=\fr{g\mu_B}{2}\sum_\sigma \sigma\delta n_\sigma\\
  &=\fr{g\mu_B}{2}\sum_{k\sigma} \sigma\pd{n_\sigma}{\epsilon_{k\sigma}}\delta \epsilon_{k\sigma}\\
  &= \fr{g\mu_B}{2}\sum_{k\sigma} \sigma\rho_{k\sigma}\rr{\sigma h + U\delta n_{- \sigma}}\\
  &= \fr{g\mu_B}{2}\sum_{\sigma} \sigma\rho_{\sigma}\rr{\sigma h + U\delta n_{- \sigma}}
\eeq   
On applying the magnetic field, the Fermi energy of spin \il{-\sigma} decreases as \il{\epsilon_F -\sigma h}.
Hence, more number of spin \il{-\sigma} electrons will get excited, the number of such excitations being
\beq
\delta n_{- \sigma} = \sum_q \delta n_{q,-\sigma} = \sum_q \Delta \epsilon_F \rho_{q-\sigma} = \sigma h\rho_{-\sigma}(0)
\eeq
In the last step, I used the fact that the density of states is non-zero only very close to the Fermi surface.
Substituting this in the magnetization gives
\beq
m &= \fr{g\mu_B}{2}h\sum_{\sigma} \sigma^2 \rho_{\sigma}(0)\rr{1 + U\rho_{-\sigma}(0)}\\
  &= \rr{\fr{g\mu_B}{2}}^2 B \sum_{\sigma} \rho_{\sigma}(0)\qq{1 + U\rho_{-\sigma}(0)
}
\eeq
The susceptibility is
\beq[mimp]
\chi_\text{imp} &= \lim_{h \to 0} \pd{m}{B}\\
		&= \rr{\fr{g\mu_B}{2}}^2 \rho_{d}(0)\qq{1 + U\rho_{d}(0)}\sum_{\sigma} \\
		&=\fr{\rr{g\mu_B}^2}{2} \rho_{d}(0)\qq{1 + U\rho_{d}(0)}\\
		&= \chi^{(0)}\fr{\rho_{d}(0)}{\rho_{d}^{(0)}(0)}\qq{1 + U\rho_{d}(0)}
\eeq
There I used the fact that in the absence of any field and \il{T \ra 0}, \il{\rho_\ua = \rho_\da = \rho_d}.
\pb
The Wilson ratio is
\beq
R \equiv \fr{\chi_\text{imp}}{\chi^{(0)}}\fr{\gamma^{(0)}}{\gamma_\text{imp}}= 1+U\rho_d(0)
\eeq

\subsubsection{Relation between the density of states and scattering phase shift}
The Green's function is of the general form
\beq
G_d(\omega) = \fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_d - i\Delta - \Sigma(\omega)}
\eeq
Close to the Fermi surface, the imaginary part of the self energy goes as \il{\omega^2}.
Therefore, up to first order in \il{\omega}, the self energy is completely real close to the Fermi surface:
\beq
\Sigma(\omega) &= \Sigma(0,0) + \omega \Sigma^\prime(0) + O(i\omega^2)\\
	       &\equiv \Sigma(0) + \rr{1 - Z^{-1}}\omega
\eeq
where \il{Z = \rr{1 - \Sigma^\prime}^{-1}}.
Substituting this in \il{G_d(\omega)} gives
\beq[impg]
G_d(\omega) &= \fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_d - i\Delta - \Sigma(0) - \rr{1 - Z^{-1}}\omega}\\
	  &= \fr{Z}{Z\omega - Z\epsilon_d - iZ\Delta - Z\Sigma(0) - Z\omega + \omega}\\
	  &= \fr{Z}{\omega - Z\rr{\epsilon_d + \Sigma(0)} - iZ\Delta }\\
	  &\equiv \fr{Z}{\omega - \epsilon_d^* - i\Delta ^*}\\
\eeq
The density of states  at the Fermi surface is given by
\beq
\rho_d(0) &= \fr{1}{\pi}\text{Im }G_d(\omega)\bigg\vert_{\omega = 0} \\
	  &= \fr{1}{\pi}\fr{Z \Delta^*}{\rr{\omega - {\epsilon_d^*}}^2 + {\Delta^*}^2}\bigg\vert_{\omega = 0}\\
	  &= \fr{1}{\pi}\fr{Z \Delta^*}{{\epsilon_d^*}^2 + {\Delta^*}^2}
\eeq
The total Green's function for the conduction electrons can be expressed in powers of the scattering potential \il{V}:
\beq
G &= G^{(0)} + G^{(0)}VG^{(0)}_dVG^{(0)} + G^{(0)}VG^{(0)}_dVG^{(0)}VG^{(0)}_dVG^{(0)} + ...\\
  &= G^{(0)} + G^{(0)}V\qq{ G^{(0)}_d + G^{(0)}_dVG^{(0)}VG^{(0)}_d} VG^{(0)}\\
  & = G^{(0)} + G^{(0)}V^2 G_d G^{(0)}\\
\eeq
Here, \il{G^{(0)}} are the bare Green functions of the conduction and impurity electron and \il{G_d} is the interaction impurity Green's function.
Comparing with
\beq[dyson]
G = G_0 + G_0 T G_0
\eeq
we can write
\beq
T = V^2 G_d 
\eeq
where \il{T} is the \il{T-}matrix for scattering of conduction electrons off the impurity.
From the optical theorem, we know that the \il{S-}matrix (\il{S(\omega) \equiv e^{2i\delta(\omega)}}) is related to the \il{T-}matrix as
\beq
e^{2i\delta(\omega)} &= 1 - 2\pi i \rho T(\omega)\\
\implies T &= V^2 G_d = \fr{1}{2\pi i \rho}\rr{1 - e^{2i\delta(\omega)}} = \fr{e^{i\delta(\omega)}}{2\pi i \rho}\rr{-2i\sin \delta} \\
\implies G_d &=  -\fr{e^{i\delta(\omega)}}{V^2\pi \rho}\sin \delta \\
\eeq
Since \il{-\fr{1}{V^2\pi \rho}\sin \delta} is real, we can write
\beq
G_d = |G_d|e^{i\delta(\omega)}
\eeq
From the expression for \il{G_d} in eq.~\ref{impg}, we can find the phase of \il{G_d}:
\beq
\delta(\omega) &= \tan^{-1}\fr{\Delta^*}{\omega - \epsilon_d^*}\\
\implies \epsilon_d^* &= -\Delta^* \cot \delta(0)
\eeq
Substituting this in the density of states expression gives
\beq
\rho_d(0) &= \fr{Z\sin^2 \delta(0)}{\pi \Delta^*}
\eeq
Substituting this expression for the density of states in the expression for the Wilson ratio gives
\beq
R = 1+\fr{U Z\sin^2 \delta(0)}{\pi \Delta^*}
\eeq
From the definition \il{\Delta^* \equiv Z\Delta}, we get
\beq
R = 1+\fr{U} {\pi \Delta}\sin^2 \delta(0)
\eeq

\subsubsection{The case of \il{\avg{n_d}=1}}
Exactly at the strong-coupling fixed point, for particle-hole symmetry, we expect the occupancy of the impurity to be \il{\avg{n_d} = 1}, because the singly-occupied state is below the Fermi level while the doubly occupied state is above.
If we now lower the Fermi level by \il{\Delta \mu} while keeping the particle-hole symmetry intact (by suitably shifting the impurity levels), the resonance in the spectral function at the Fermi surface will persist, because the electrons at the Fermi surface will always form a singlet with the impurity and go into a bound state.
\pb
Since the energies are measured relative to the Fermi level, all quasiparticle energies will increase by \il{\Delta \epsilon_{k\sigma} = \Delta \mu}.
However, some of the quasiparticles closer to the Fermi surface will now come below it,so that the number of quasiparticles will decrease by \il{\Delta n = -\Delta \mu \rho_d(0)}.
The net change in \il{n_\ua} is thus
\beq
\Delta n_\ua &= \delta n_\ua(\epsilon_{k\ua} + \mu) - \delta n_\ua(\epsilon_{k\ua})\\
	     &=\rho_d(0)\rr{\Delta \mu + U\Delta n_\da}\\
	     &= \rho_d(0)\rr{\Delta \mu - U\rho_d(0)\Delta \mu}\\
	     &=\rho_d(0)\Delta \mu\rr{1 - U\rho_d(0)}\\
\eeq
At the Kondo limit, the impurity occupation is fixed at 1 because the resonance in the spectral function of the conduction electrons is pinned at the Fermi energy.
This means that even if we shift the Fermi energy, the resonance moves with it, and there should be no change \il{\Delta n_\ua}.
Hence,
\beq[nosusc]
1 - U\rho_d(0) = 0 \implies U\rho_d(0) = 1
\eeq
Substituting \il{\avg{n_{d\sigma}} = \hf} and \il{\epsilon_d = -\fr{U}{2}} in the density of states eq.~\ref{dosint} gives \il{\rho_d(0) = \fr{1}{\pi \Delta} = \fr{1}{U}}.
This can be substituted in the Wilson ratio to give
\beq
R = 1 + \sin^2 \delta(0)
\eeq
\subsubsection{Connection to the change in Luttinger's volume}
From the Friedel sum rule\footnote{JS Langer and V Ambegaokar.
Friedel sum rule for a system of interacting electrons}, we can relate the phase shift \il{\delta(0)} due to scattering (at the Fermi surface) off a local impurity to the number of electrons bound in the potential well produced by that impurity:
\beq
\wl N = \fr{1}{2\pi i}\text{Tr }\ln S(0) = \int_\Gamma dz\partial_z \fr{1}{2\pi i}\text{Tr }\ln S(0)
\eeq
From the optical theorem, we can write
\beq
S = 1 + TG_0 = \fr{G}{G_0} && \qq{\text{eq.~\ref{dyson}}}
\eeq
This allows us to write\footnote{Mukherjee and Lal-Holographic unitary renormalization group for correlated electrons - I: A tensor network approach-https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2020.115170}
\beq
\wl N = \int_\Gamma dz\partial_z \fr{1}{2\pi i}\text{Tr }\ln \fr{G}{G_0}
\eeq
Since \il{\text{Tr }\ln \hat O = \sum_\lambda \ln O_\lambda = \ln \prod_\lambda O_\lambda = \ln Det \hat O}, we get
\beq
\wl N &= \int_\Gamma dz\partial_z \fr{1}{2\pi i}\ln \text{Det } \fr{G}{G_0}\\
      &= -\int_\Gamma dz\partial_z \fr{1}{2\pi i}\ln \fr{\text{Det } G_0}{\text{Det } G}\\
      &\equiv -\int_\Gamma dz\partial_z \fr{1}{2\pi i}\ln D\\
      &= -\int_{\Gamma(D)}\fr{dD}{D}
\eeq
From the work of Seki and Yunoki\footnote{Topological interpretation of the luttinger theorem.
Physical Review B, 96(8):085124, 2017}, we know that this quantity is essentially the winding number of the curve \il{\Gamma(D)} in the complex plane spanned by the real and imaginary parts of \il{D}, and is equal to the change in Luttinger's volume \il{V_L} at \il{T=0}.
\beq
\wl N &= -\int_{\Gamma(D)}\fr{dD}{D} = -\Delta V_L
\eeq
The incoming electrons can have \il{\sigma = \ua,\da}.
Since the impurity singlet ground state is rotationally invariant, we have \il{\delta_\ua = \delta_\da = \delta(0)}.
\beq
\wl N &= \fr{1}{\pi}\sum_\sigma\delta_\sigma(0)\\
\implies \delta(0) &= \fr{\pi}{2}\wl N = -\fr{\pi}{2}\Delta V_L
\eeq
\beq
R &= 1 + \sin^2 \rr{\fr{\pi}{2}\wl N}\\
  &= 1 + \sin^2 \rr{\fr{\pi}{2}\Delta V_L}
\eeq
\pagebreak

\subsection{Microscopic approach}
The average occupation for the non-interacting quasiparticles can be similarly written from eq.~\ref{nandemonayi}.
\beq
\avg{\wl n_d} =\hf - \fr{1}{\pi}\tan^{-1}\fr{\wl\epsilon_d}{\wl\Delta} = \hf - \fr{1}{\pi}\tan^{-1}\fr{\epsilon_d - \Sigma(0)}{\Delta} = \avg{n_d} 
\eeq
This shows that the quasiparticles are in one-one correspondence with the actual particles.
For a Fermi liquid, the specific heat is given by \il{\wl C_v = \fr{2\pi^2 k_B^2}{3}\wl\rho(0)T}.
Applying it to the problem at hand, we get
\beq[eren]
\gamma_\text{imp} = \fr{2\pi k_B^2}{3}\fr{\wl\Delta}{\wl \epsilon_d^2 + \wl\Delta^2}
\eeq
This matches with the value obtained from Nozières treatment.
Luttinger also proved that, up to first order,
\begin{gather}
	\chi_\text{m,imp} = \fr{g^2 \mu_B^2}{2}\alpha^\prime \rho_d(0)\\\label{mikasa}
\chi_\text{c,imp} = 2\alpha^{\prime\prime}\rho_d(0)
\end{gather}
where
\begin{gather}
\alpha^\prime = \fr{1-\partial_h\Sigma_\sigma(\epsilon_F,0)}{1-\partial_E\Sigma_\sigma(\epsilon_F,0)}\\
\alpha^{\prime\prime}=\fr{1+\partial_\mu\Sigma_\sigma(\epsilon_F,0)}{1-\partial_E\Sigma_\sigma(\epsilon_F,0)}
\end{gather}

\subsection{Renormalized perturbation theory}
This is a perturbative expansion of the Hamiltonian in terms of the renormalised inteaction \il{\wl U}, and the second order results obtained from this approach coincide with the phenomenological results at \il{T,h \ra 0}..
This approach is obviously more general as all terms in the original Hamiltonian are retained.
This is an alternative to the full microscopic approach.
In the microscopic approach, we take the exact microscopic Hamiltonian and calculate observables from it.
In the renormalised perturbation, we separate the Hamiltonian into a non-interacting  quasiparticle Hamiltonian which is like the low-energy free Hamiltonian, and an interacting part, and also a counter-term to prevent divergences.
The original parameters of the model get replaced by renormalised paramters, and we can analyse the model perturbatively in powers of the renormalised interaction.\\\\
To do a perturbative expansion of the Hamiltonian in terms of the interaction \il{U}, it is useful to introduce the self energy \il{\Sigma(E) = \Sigma(0) + E\Sigma^\prime + \Sigma^\text{rem}(E)}.
In the absence of interaction, the impurity Green's function is
\beq
G_d^0 = \fr{1}{E - \epsilon_d + i\Delta}
\eeq
Including the self energy gives
\beq[greend1]
G_d = \fr{1}{E - \epsilon_d + i\Delta - \Sigma(E)}
\eeq
As shown previously in section \ref{adiab}, the impurity Green's function can be shown to take the form
\beq[greend2]
G_d = \fr{Z}{E - \wl \epsilon_d + i\wl \Delta - \wl \Sigma(E)}
\eeq
where the \il{\tilde{\quad}} represents the renormalised quantities
\beq[renpar]
 \wl \epsilon_d &= Z(\epsilon_d +\Sigma(0))\\
 \wl \Delta &= Z\Delta\\
 \wl \Sigma &= Z\Sigma^\text{rem}(E)\\
 Z^{-1} &= 1 - \Sigma(0)^\prime\\
 \wl \Gamma_{\sigma\sigma^\prime}(E,E^\prime) &= z^2 \Gamma_{\sigma\sigma^\prime}(E,E^\prime) \\
 \wl U &= z^2 \Gamma_{\ua\da}(0,0)
\eeq
The perturbative expansion is about the bare Hamiltonian, that is, the one with \il{\wl\Sigma = 0}.
The corresponding Greens function (non-interacting quasiparticle Green's function) is
\beq[nandemonayi]
\wl G_d = \fr{1}{E - \wl\epsilon_d + i\wl\Delta}
\eeq
The Anderson hamiltonian
\beq
H = \epsilon_d n_d + Un_{d\ua}n_{d\da} + \sum_k \epsilon_k n_k + \sum_k \rr{V_k c^\dagger_{d\sigma}c_{k\sigma}+V_k^* c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c_{d\sigma}}
\eeq
can be written in the form
\beq[id]
H = \wl H_{qp} - \wl H_c
\eeq
\il{\wl H_{qp} = \wl H_{qp}^0 + \wl H_{qp}^I} is the total quasiparticle Hamiltonian, consisting of a non-interacting part \il{\wl H_{qp}^0} and an interaction \il{\wl H_{qp}^I}.
\begin{gather}
\wl H_{qp}^0 = \wl \epsilon_d \wl n_d + \sum_k \epsilon_k n_k + \sum_k \rr{\wl V_k \wl c^\dagger_{d\sigma}c_{k\sigma}+\wl V_k^* c^\dagger_{k\sigma}\wl c_{d\sigma}}\\
\wl H_{qp}^I = \wl U \wl n_{d\ua}\wl n_{d\da}
\end{gather}
The renormalised parameters are defined in eq.~\ref{renpar}.
The renormalised operators are
\begin{gather}
\wl c^\dagger_d = \sqrt z c^\dagger_d\\
\wl c_d = \sqrt z c_d
\end{gather}
The \il{\wl H_c} that satisfies eq.~\ref{id} is
\beq
\wl H_c = \lambda_1 \wl n_d + \lambda_2 \wl n_{d\ua}\wl n_{d\da}
\eeq
where
\begin{gather}
\lambda_1 = z\Sigma(0,0)\\
\lambda_2 = z^2 \qq{\Gamma_{\ua\da}(0,0) - U}
\end{gather}
\il{\wl H_{qp}} is the effective Hamiltonian close to the strong-coupling fixed point.
\il{\wl H_c} is the counter-term.
It is introduced to cancel divergences.
Close to the Fermi surface, we want the renormalised self-energy \il{\wl \Sigma(E)} to vary as \il{E^2}.
That gives two constraints
\beq[conditions]
\wl \Sigma(0) &= 0\\
\wl \Sigma^\prime(0) &= 0
\eeq
Close to the Fermi surface, we also have
\begin{gather}
\wl\Gamma_{\ua\da}(0) = \wl U\\
\wl\Gamma_{\sigma\sigma}(0) = 0\\
\implies\Gamma_{\sigma\sigma^\prime}(0) = \wl U(1-\delta_{\sigma\sigma^\prime})
\end{gather}
This is the third constraint.
The perturbation expansion is in powers of the renormalised interaction \il{\wl U}.
The parameters that are determined by the expansion are \il{\lambda_1,\lambda_2,z}.
Hence, they should be expanded in powers of \il{\wl U}.
\begin{gather}
\lambda_i =  \sum_n \lambda_i^{(n)}\wl U^n\\
z = \sum_n z^{(n)}\wl U^n\\
\end{gather}
The expansion is about the non-interacting quasiparticle Hamiltonian.
The corresponding Green's function is
\beq
G^0 = \fr{1}{E -\wl\epsilon_d +i\wl \Delta}
\eeq
From the Friedel sum rule in the next section, we get
\beq
\avg{n_{d\sigma}} = \hf - \fr{1}{\pi}\tan^{-1} \fr{\epsilon_d + \Sigma(0,h)}{\Delta}
\eeq
Multiplying the numerator and denominator by \il{z}, we get the same occupancy in terms of the renormalised parameters.
\beq[jean]
\avg{n_{d\sigma}} = \hf - \fr{1}{\pi}\tan^{-1} \fr{\wl\epsilon_d +\wl \Sigma(0,h)}{\wl\Delta}
\eeq
For \il{T,h \ra 0}, the counter-term cancels appropriate terms from the quasiparticle Hamiltonian leading to the vanishing of the effects of the self-energy, eq.~\ref{conditions}.
In that case, \il{\avg{n_{d\sigma}} = \avg{n^0_{d\sigma}}}, that is, the quasiparticle distribution becomes the same as the free fermionic distribution.\\\\
The first order Feynman diagram for the self-energy is of the Hartree type.
They give a contribution
\beq
\wl \Sigma(\omega,H,T) = \wl U\rr{n^{(0)}_{d\sigma}(0,H,T) - n^{(0)}_{d\sigma}(0,0,0)}
\eeq
This satisfies the constraint eq.~\ref{conditions}.
That is, \il{\Sigma^{(1)}(0,0) = 0}.
With the expression for self-energy, we can write down the impurity magnetic susceptibility, \il{\chi_d = \pd{m}{B}}, where
\beq
m = \fr{g \mu_B}{2} \avg{n_{d\ua} - n_{d\da}}
\eeq
We can substitute the expression for the self-energy into eq.~\ref{jean}.
That gives
\beq
\chi_d = \hf\rr{g \mu_B}^2 \pd{\avg{n_{d\ua} - n_{d\da}}}{h} = \fr{1}{2\pi}\rr{g \mu_B}^2 \pd{}{h}\rr{\tan^{-1}\fr{\wl \epsilon_{d\da}}{\wl \Delta} - \tan^{-1} \fr{\wl \epsilon_{d\ua}}{\wl \Delta}}
\eeq
where \il{h = g\mu_B B} and \il{\wl\epsilon_{d\sigma} = \wl\epsilon_d + \wl Un_{d\sigma}^{(0)}}.
Performing the derivative and taking the limits of \il{T \ra 0} and \il{B \ra 0} gives
\beq
\chi_d = \fr{1}{2\pi}\rr{g \mu_B}^2 \fr{1}{1 + \rr{\fr{\wl \epsilon_d}{\wl \Delta}}^2}\fr{1}{\wl \Delta}\pd{}{h}\qq{\wl\epsilon_{d\da} - \wl\epsilon_{d\ua}}
\eeq
We can recognize that 
\beq
\fr{1}{1 + \rr{\fr{\wl \epsilon_d}{\wl \Delta}}^2} \fr{1}{\pi  \wl \Delta} = \fr{1}{\pi} \fr{\wl \Delta}{\wl\Delta^2 + \wl \epsilon_d^2} = \rho_d(0)
\eeq
Therefore,
\beq
\chi_d = \hf\rr{g \mu_B}^2 \rho_d(0) \pd{}{h}\qq{\wl\epsilon_{d\da} - \wl\epsilon_{d\ua}}
\eeq
Up to first order, we can write
\beq
\wl\epsilon_{d\da} - \wl\epsilon_{d\ua} = \epsilon_{d\da} - \epsilon_{d\ua} + \wl U\rr{n^{(0)}_{d\da} - n^{(0)}_{d\ua}} = 2\epsilon_d + h + \wl U\rr{n^{(0)}_{d\da} - n^{(0)}_{d\ua}}
\eeq
where I used \il{\epsilon_{d\sigma}(h) = \epsilon_d - \fr{h}{2}\sigma}.
Substituting this in the expression for \il{\chi_d} gives
\beq
\pd{}{h}\qq{\wl\epsilon_{d\da} - \wl\epsilon_{d\ua}} = 1 + \wl U \rr{\pd{n^{(0)}_{d\da}}{\epsilon_{d\da}}\pd{\epsilon_{d\da}}{h} - \pd{n^{(0)}_{d\ua}}{\epsilon_{d\ua}}\pd{\epsilon_{d\ua}}{h}}
\eeq
Up to first order, we can approximate \il{\pd{\epsilon_{d\sigma}}{h} = \fr{\sigma}{2}}, therefore,
\beq
\pd{}{h}\qq{\wl\epsilon_{d\da} - \wl\epsilon_{d\ua}} = 1 + \wl U\rho_d(0)
\eeq
Substituting in to the parent equation, we get
\beq
\chi_d = \hf\rr{g \mu_B}^2 \rho_d(0) \rr{1 + \wl U \rho_d(0)}
\eeq
which is same as the one obtained from mean-field.\\\\
It is possible to take higher order contributions into account, but there are identities which show that these results are exact.

\begin{gather}
\rr{\pd{}{E} + \pd{}{\mu}}\Sigma(E)\bigg\vert_{E = 0} = -\rho_{d\sigma}(0)\Gamma_{\ua\da}(0,0)\\
\rr{\pd{}{h} - \pd{}{E}}\Sigma(E)\bigg\vert_{E = 0} = -\rho_{d\sigma}(0)\Gamma_{\ua\da}(0,0)
\end{gather}
Multiplying both equations throughout by \il{Z}, we get
\begin{gather}
	\rr{\pd{}{E} + \pd{}{\mu}}\wl \Sigma(E)\bigg\vert_{E = 0} = -Z\rho_{d\sigma}(0)\Gamma_{\ua\da}(0,0) = -\fr{1}{Z}\rho_{d\sigma}(0)\wl U\\
\rr{\pd{}{h} - \pd{}{E}}\wl \Sigma(E)\bigg\vert_{E = 0} = -Z\rho_{d\sigma}(0)\Gamma_{\ua\da}(0,0)=-\fr{1}{Z}\rho_{d\sigma}(0)\wl U
\end{gather}
where I used \il{Z^2 \Gamma = \wl U}.
We also have the relation \il{\wl \rho_d = \fr{1}{Z}\rho_d}, because
\beq
\wl \rho(0) \sim \fr{\wl \Delta}{\wl \epsilon_d^2 + \wl \Delta^2} = \fr{1}{Z} \fr{\Delta}{\epsilon_d^2 + \Delta^2}= \fr{1}{Z}\rho_d(0)
\eeq
Noting that the derivating of the renormalised self energy goes to zero at the Fermi surface, we get
\beq[grisha]
\pd{\wl \Sigma(E)}{\mu} \bigg\vert_{E=0} = \pd{\wl \Sigma(E)}{h} \bigg\vert_{E=0} = -\wl\rho_{d\sigma}(0)\wl U
\eeq
These can be used to prove the mean-field results regarding specific heat and the susceptibilities.
Similar to the mean field treatment, close to \il{T=0}, the effects of the self energy vanish, and the specific heat linear term, \il{\gamma}, involves only the non-interacting density of states.
\beq
\wl \gamma \sim \wl \rho_d(0)
\eeq
The susceptibilities are given by
\beq
\chi_m = -\rr{\fr{g\mu_B}{2}}^2 \wl \rho_d \sum_\sigma \pd{\rr{\epsilon_{k} -h\sigma + \wl\Sigma}}{h} = \fr{g^2 \mu_B^2}{2}\wl \rho_d \rr{1 - \pd{\wl\Sigma}{h}}
\eeq
Substituting from eq.~\ref{grisha},
\beq
\chi_m = \fr{g^2 \mu_B^2}{2}\wl \rho_d \rr{1 + \wl U\wl\rho_d(0)}
\eeq
Similarly,
\beq
\chi_c = \dv{n}{\mu} = \wl\rho_d(0)\sum_\sigma\dv{\rr{\epsilon_F + \wl \Sigma}}{\mu} = 2\wl\rho_d(0)\rr{1+\pd{\wl\Sigma}{\mu}} = 2\wl\rho_d(0)\rr{1-\wl U\wl \rho_d(0)}
\eeq
\subsubsection{Friedel sum rule}

Looking at eq.~\ref{greend1}, we can write down the density of states and hence the average occupancy of the impurity site
\begin{gather}
	\rho_{d\sigma} = \fr{-1}{\pi}\text{Im}\qq{G_d}\label{jaeger} \\
	\avg{n_{d\sigma}} = \int_{-\infty}^0 dE\;\rho_{d\sigma} = -\fr{1}{\pi}\text{Im}\int_{-\infty}^0 dE\;\;G_d(E)\label{allforone}
\end{gather}
Luttinger proved that 
\beq
\int_{-\infty}^0 \Sigma^\prime G dE = 0
\eeq
In order to use this, note that
\beq
		     &\ln G_d^{-1}  = \ln\rr{E - \epsilon_d +i\Delta -\Sigma}\\
		     &\implies \dv{\ln G_d^{-1}}{E} = \fr{1}{E - \epsilon_d +i\Delta -\Sigma}\rr{1 - \Sigma^\prime} = G_d - \Sigma^\prime G_d\\
		     &\implies G_d = \Sigma^\prime G_d - \dv{\ln G_d}{E}
\eeq
Substituting this expression for \il{G_d} in eq.~\ref{allforone},
\beq
\avg{n_{d\sigma}} = -\fr{1}{\pi}\text{Im}\int_{-\infty}^0\Sigma^\prime G\;dE +\fr{1}{\pi}\text{Im}\int_{-\infty}^0\dv{\ln G_d}{E}dE
\eeq
The first integral is zero, courtesy Luttinger.
We get
\beq
\avg{n_{d\sigma}} &= \fr{1}{\pi}\text{Im}\qq{\ln \fr{1}{E - \epsilon_d +i\Delta -\Sigma}}_{-\infty}^0\\
&=-\fr{1}{\pi}\text{Im}\qq{\ln \rr{E - \epsilon_d +i\Delta -\Sigma}}_{-\infty}^0\\
&=-\fr{1}{\pi}\text{Im}\qq{\ln{e^{i\theta}}}_{-\infty}^0 && \qq{\tan \theta = \fr{\Delta}{E - \epsilon_d -\Sigma}}\\
&= -\fr{1}{\pi}\qq{\theta(0) - \theta(-\infty)}\\
&= \fr{1}{\pi}\tan^{-1}\fr{\Delta}{\epsilon_d+\Sigma(0,h)}\\
&=\hf - \fr{1}{\pi}\tan^{-1}\fr{\epsilon_d+\Sigma(0,h)}{\Delta}
\eeq
We can now relate the average occupancy with the density of states.
From eq.~\ref{jaeger},
\beq

\subsection{Scaling of Anderson model}
First consider the case in which \il{\epsilon_d \ll -D, U+\epsilon_d \gg D}.
The situation is such that both the impurity levels are fat outside the bandwidth, as shown in fig.~\ref{and1}.
The maximum energy scale at which scattering with conduction electrons can take place is of the order of the bandwidth \il{D}.
Since the impurity energies are much higher than the bandwidth, no charge fluctuation can take place.
The impurity state will be fixed at \il{\epsilon_d}.
The only remaining degree of freedom will be the spin fluctuations, and we can then do the S-W transformation.\\\\
On the other hand, if we take the situation in fig.~\ref{and2} where both the impurity levels are far inside the bandwidth, then both the impurity levels will be on energy scales completely different from the bandwidth.
So there wont be any renormalization of the impurity levels.
From another perspective, it can be said that there won't be any renormalization because both the impurity levels \il{\ket{0},\ket{1}} will be able to hybridise with two states each: \il{\ket{0}} can hybridize with \il{\ket{k\ua},\ket{k\da}} and \il{\ket{1\sigma}} can hybridize with \il{\ket{0},\ket{2}}.

%\end{minipage}
The limit where there will be some renormalization is the following.
We are working with the asymmetric Anderson model, that is,\\ \il{U + \epsilon_d \gg D \gg |\epsilon_d|,\Delta}.
The total Hamiltonian is
\beq
H = \sum_{k\sigma} \epsilon_{k\sigma}n_{k\sigma} + \epsilon_d \sum_\sigma n_{d\sigma} + U n_{d\ua}n_{d\da} + \sum_{k\sigma}\rr{V_{kd} c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c_{d\sigma} + V^*_{kd}c^\dagger_{d\sigma}c_{k\sigma}}
\eeq
This means that the doubly-occupied state is decoupled from the conduction band; it cannot hybridize through the \il{V_{kd}} because the virtual transition will involve a huge amount of energy and so it is practically impossible.\\\\
At the first iteration, we will reduce the cut-off from \il{D} to \il{D - \delta D}.
The zeroth approximation to this Hamiltonian is
\beq
H^{(0)} = \sum_{k<D-\delta D, \sigma} \epsilon_{k\sigma}n_{k\sigma} + \epsilon_d \sum_\sigma n_{d\sigma} + \sum_{k<D-\delta D,\sigma}\rr{V_{kd} c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c_{d\sigma} + V^*_{kd}c^\dagger_{d\sigma}c_{k\sigma}}
\eeq
As is apparent, the zeroth approximation involves completely ignoring the region to be integrated out.
All kinetic energies and actual scatterings are strictly within the smaller region \il{[-D + \delta D, D - \delta D]}.
The higher approximations  allow these states to make virtual transitions to the band edge states and then come back.
The Hamiltonian term for the virtual excitation in to the upper band edge (with a particle in the intermediate state) is
\beq
H^{(1,p)}_\sigma = \sum_{k\in k^+} \alpha_{k\sigma} c^\dagger_{d\sigma} c_{k\sigma}c^\dagger_{k\sigma} c_{d\sigma}
\eeq
There are two things to note here.
Firstly, \il{\alpha_{k\sigma}} is the probability of such a virtual transition and is found from perturbation theory.
Secondly, the summation \il{k^+} is over the states in \il{[D-\delta D,D]}.
To calculate \il{\alpha_{k\sigma}}, note that such a virtual excitation can take place only from the state \il{1_{d\sigma}}.
Therefore, we look at the first order correction to this state under the perturbation \il{V_{kd}}.
\beq
\alpha_{k\sigma} = \fr{\bra{1_{d\sigma}}V^*_{kd} c^\dagger_{d\sigma} c_{k\sigma}\ket{k\sigma}\bra{k\sigma}V_{kd}c^\dagger_{k\sigma} c_{d\sigma}\ket{1_{d\sigma}}}{E_{1_d\sigma} - E_{k\sigma}} = \fr{|V_{kd}|^2}{\epsilon_d - \epsilon_k}
\eeq
The analogous term in the same order for the virtual transition to the lower edge consists of a hole in the intermediate state, because the lower edge states are already filled.
This term is of the form
\beq
H^{(1,h)} = \sum_{k\in k^-,\sigma} \beta_{k\sigma} c^\dagger_{k\sigma} c_{d\sigma} c_{k\sigma} c_{d\sigma}^\dagger
\eeq
\il{\beta_{k\sigma}} is calculated similarly, using perturbation theory.

\beq
\beta_{k\sigma} = \fr{\bra{0}V^*_{kd} c_{d\sigma} c^\dagger_{k\sigma}\ket{k\sigma}\bra{k\sigma}V_{kd}c_{k\sigma} c^\dagger_{d\sigma}\ket{0}}{E_0 - E_{k\sigma}} = \fr{|V_{kd}|^2}{\epsilon_k - \epsilon_d}
\eeq
The total first order  correction to the Hamiltonian is of the form
\beq
H^{(1)} = \sum_{k^+,\sigma}\alpha_{k\sigma} T^+_{k\sigma} + \sum_{k^-,\sigma}\beta_{k\sigma} T^-_{k\sigma}
\eeq
\il{T^{+,-}} represent virtual transitions to the upper and lower edges.
Since these terms do not cause any real fluctuations in the impurity sites, they renormalize only the impurity energy \il{\epsilon_d}, and not the hybridisation coupling \il{V_{kd}}.
To find the renormalization in the site energies \il{\epsilon_0} and \il{\epsilon_1} (and hence in \il{\epsilon_d \equiv \epsilon_1 - \epsilon_0}), note that the term \il{T^+} virtually excites the state \il{n_{d\sigma} = 1}, and hence the change in \il{\epsilon_{1}} is
\beq
\delta \epsilon_{1} = \alpha_{k\sigma} = \sum_{k^+}\fr{|V_{kd}|^2}{\epsilon_d - \epsilon_k}
\eeq
We can write this summation in terms of \il{\Delta(E) = \pi N(E) V^2(E)}, under the assumption \il{\Delta (E) \approx \Delta} for \il{E \in \{-D,D\}}.
\beq
\delta \epsilon_{1} =\sum_{k^+}\fr{|V_{kd}|^2}{\epsilon_d - \epsilon_k} = \int_{D-\delta D}^{D} dE N(E) \frac{|V(E)|^2}{\epsilon_d - E} \approx \frac{\Delta}{\pi}\fr{ |\delta D|}{\epsilon_d - D}
\eeq
The change in \il{\epsilon_0} is
\beq
\delta \epsilon_{0} = \sum_\sigma \beta_{k\sigma} \approx -2\frac{\Delta}{\pi}\fr{ |\delta D|}{\epsilon_d + D}
\eeq
The change in the denominator occurs because in the lower edge, \il{\epsilon_k = -D}.
 The change in \il{\epsilon_d} is
\beq
\delta \epsilon_d = \delta \epsilon_1 - \delta \epsilon_0 = \fr{\Delta |\delta D|}{\pi}\qq{\fr{1}{\epsilon_d - D} + \fr{2}{\epsilon_d +D}} = \fr{\Delta}{\pi}\fr{|\delta D|}{D} = -\fr{\Delta}{\pi}\delta\ln D
\eeq
We assumed \il{D \gg \epsilon_d}.
In the limit of infinitesimal change, we get the equation
\beq[scale_eq]
\dv{\epsilon_d}{\ln D} = -\fr{\Delta}{\pi}
\eeq
If we had allowed the \il{\ket{1_{d\sigma}}} to hybridize with the state \il{\ket{2_d}} (that is, if we had assumed both \il{U} and \il{\epsilon_d} to be \il{\ll D}), then \il{\alpha_{k\sigma}} would have had another term added to it:
\beq
\fr{|V_{kd}|^2}{\epsilon_k - U -\epsilon_d} \approx  \fr{|V|^2}{-D - U -\epsilon_d}
\eeq
\il{-(U+\epsilon_d)} is the change in energy from \il{\ket{1_d}} to \il{\ket{2_d}} and \il{-D} is the energy of the hole created in the process.
The renormalization in \il{\epsilon_d} would then have been
\beq
\delta \epsilon_d = \fr{\Delta |\delta D|}{\pi}\rr{\fr{1}{\epsilon_d - D} - \fr{1}{D + U + \epsilon_d} + \fr{2}{\epsilon_d + D}}
\eeq
which is zero in the limit of \il{U,|\epsilon_d| \ll D}.
This is the equal renormalization in \il{\epsilon_0} and \il{\epsilon_1} discussed earlier.\\\\
We do not yet know whether \il{\Delta} is a function of the cutoff \il{D}.
To find the renormalization of \il{\Delta}, we need to find the renormalization of \il{V_{kd}}.
Note that the lowest order virtual transitions do not cause any actual charge fluctuation, and hence they do not renormalize \il{V_{kd}}.
To see the renormalization of \il{V_{kd}}, we need to consider one order higher.
These higher order terms involve transitions within the lower subspace along with virtual transitions into the higher subspaces.
\beq
H^{(2)} = \sum_{k^+,q,\sigma}\alpha_{k\sigma} T^+_{k\sigma}\gamma_{q,k,\sigma}c^\dagger_{d\sigma}c_{q\sigma} + \sum_{k^-,q,\sigma}\beta_{k\sigma} T^-_{k\sigma}\gamma_{q,k,\sigma}c_{d\sigma}c^\dagger_{q\sigma}
\eeq
The \il{\gamma_{k\sigma}} can be calculated as 
\beq
\alpha_{k\sigma}\gamma_{q,k,\sigma} = \fr{\bra{1_{d\sigma}}V^*_{kd} c^\dagger_{d\sigma} c_{k\sigma}\ket{k\sigma}\bra{k\sigma}V_{kd}c^\dagger_{k\sigma} c_{d\sigma}\ket{1_{d\sigma}}\bra{1_{d\sigma}}V_{kd}c_{q\sigma} c^\dagger_{d\sigma}\ket{q\sigma}}{(E_{1_d\sigma} - E_{k\sigma})(E_q - E_k)} \\
= \alpha_{k\sigma}\fr{V_{kd}}{\epsilon_q - \epsilon_k}
\eeq
The renormalization in \il{V_{kd}} is therefore
\beq
\delta V_{kd} = \fr{\Delta}{\pi}\fr{|\delta D|}{\epsilon_d - D}\fr{V_{kd}}{\epsilon_q - \epsilon_k}
\eeq
Close to the band edge, we get
\beq
\delta V = \fr{\Delta}{\pi}\fr{|\delta D|}{\epsilon_d - D}\fr{V}{\epsilon_q - D} \approx \fr{\Delta}{\pi}\fr{|\delta D|}{D^2}V
\eeq
Therefore,
\beq[mirai2]
\delta \Delta \sim V\delta V = \fr{\Delta V^2}{\pi D^2}|\delta D| \implies \dv{\Delta}{D} \sim \rr{\fr{\Delta}{D}}^2
\eeq
For \il{D \gg \Delta}, this will vanish very quickly.
Hence, in this regime, there is no renormalization of \il{\Delta}, and we can take it to be a constant in the renormalization flow.
Integrating eq.~\ref{scale_eq} gives
\beq
\epsilon_d = -\fr{\Delta}{\pi}\ln D + \text{constant}
\eeq
Defining the constant as 
\beq
\text{constant} = \epsilon_d^* + \fr{\Delta}{\pi}\ln \Delta
\eeq
we get
\begin{gather}
\epsilon_d = -\fr{\Delta}{\pi}\ln D +  \epsilon_d^* + \fr{\Delta}{\pi}\ln \Delta \\
\implies \epsilon_d = \epsilon_d^* - \fr{\Delta}{\pi}\ln \fr{D}{\Delta}\label{const}
\end{gather}
This result is in the regime \il{U + \epsilon_d \gg D \gg |\epsilon_d|}.
Even if \il{U \ll D} initially, scaling will begin once \il{D \sim U}.
Until then, as mentioned previously, both \il{\epsilon_1} and \il{\epsilon_0} will change equally and there won't be any scaling in \il{\epsilon_d}.
If we start with \il{U \ll D}, under scaling, as \il{D} will decrease, there won't be any renormalization until we reach the point \il{D \sim U}.\\\\
Say, as a result of scaling, the bandwidth decreases and \il{\epsilon_d} increases (which it will, as is apparent from the eq.~\ref{const}).
At some point, \il{-D \lesssim \epsilon_d}.
At this point, perturbation theory breaks down and we resort to SWT.
We denote this point of the scaling by \il{D = -a\wl \epsilon_d, a > 1}.
We can then express the SWT coupling constant \il{\wl J} by replacing \il{\epsilon_d} with \il{\wl \epsilon_d} in eq.~\ref{jexpr}.
For simplicity set \il{U = \infty}.
Then,
\beq[historia]
\wl J = -\fr{|V|^2}{\wl \epsilon_d} = \fr{a|V|^2}{D}
\eeq
We can then do the poor man's scaling with this coupling.
From eq.~\ref{sol},
\beq
T_K \sim D \sqrt{\wl J N(0)^2} \ex{-\fr{1}{2 \wl J N(0)^2}} = \sqrt{\Delta D}\ex{-\fr{D}{2\Delta}}\\
\sim D\sqrt{\fr{\Delta}{D}}\ex{\fr{\epsilon_d}{2\Delta}}
\eeq
A different result is obtained if one is in the regime of \il{\epsilon_d < -D}.
This is the situation mentioned at the very beginning of the discussion, fig.~\ref{and1}.
Assuming \il{U \ra \infty} and \il{\epsilon_d} outside the conduction band, we can do a SWT and the \il{T_K} obtained is q.~\ref{sol},
\begin{gather}
	J = -\fr{V^2}{\epsilon_d}\\
	g = J\rho = -\fr{\Delta}{\epsilon_d}\\
	\implies T_K = D\sqrt{\fr{\Delta}{\epsilon_d}}\ex{\fr{\epsilon_d}{2\Delta}}\label{jean2}
\end{gather}
The two forms of the Kondo temperature show that the prefactor is not a universal function; it depends on the starting conditions (the microscopic Hamiltonian from which we start the scaling).
But the universal fact is that in the local moment regime (\il{U \ra \infty}), all physical quantities will involve only one energy scale, \il{T_K}.
This \il{T_K} itself might be different based on the starting Hamiltonian.\\\\
For \il{\epsilon_d^* \gg \Delta}, the renormalization will stop at \il{D \sim \epsilon_d}.
Note that we had assumed \il{D \gg \epsilon_d}.
That was the starting condition, that is, \il{\epsilon_d} deep inside the Fermi surface.
During the renormalization, \il{D} will keep on decreasing and \il{\epsilon_d} will continuously increase.
At some value of \il{D}, they will become equal and the impurity level will go outside the Fermi surface.
At this point, none of the impurity levels can renormalize any more, because the relevant energy scales are greater than the cutoff.
Hence the renormalization stops at this point.
\begin{figure} \includegraphics[scale=0.29]{full.png}\caption{Renormalization in the energy levels when \il{\epsilon_d^* \gg \Delta}}\end{figure}
This point is given by \il{\ol D = a\epsilon_d(\ol D) \equiv \ol \epsilon_d} where \il{a} is a constant of order unity.
It satisfies the equation
\beq[eraser]
\ol \epsilon_d = \epsilon_d^* - \fr{\Delta}{\pi}\ln \fr{a\ol \epsilon_d}{\Delta}
\eeq
which is just eq.~\ref{const} with the substitution \il{D =a  \ol \epsilon_d}.
In this regime, because \il{\epsilon_d \gg \Delta}, we can do a perturbative expansion of the  bare Hamiltonian in terms of \il{\fr{\Delta}{\epsilon_d}}.
The susceptibility is
\beq
\chi_d = \fr{\Delta}{2\pi}\rr{\fr{g \mu_B}{\epsilon_d}}^2\qq{1 + \fr{2\Delta}{\pi \epsilon_d}\ln \fr{\epsilon_d}{D} + ...}
\eeq
From the scaling, we know that \il{D} can be decreased to \il{\ol D}.
We can hence substitute \il{D =a \ol \epsilon_d, \epsilon_d = \ol \epsilon_d}.
With this in mind, the susceptibility becomes
\beq
\chi_d = \fr{\Delta}{2\pi}\rr{\fr{g \mu_B}{\ol\epsilon_d}}^2\qq{1 + \fr{2\Delta}{\pi \ol\epsilon_d}\ln a + ...} \\
= \fr{\Delta}{2\pi}\rr{\fr{g \mu_B}{\ol \epsilon_d}}^2\qq{1 +\text{O}\rr{\fr{2\Delta}{\pi \ol\epsilon_d}}}
\eeq
where I used the fact that \il{\ln a } will be of order 1.
As we go on decreasing the cutoff, the impurity level will go on moving farther away from the Fermi level, and impurity site will become null occupied: \il{\avg{n_d} \approx 0}.
The critical cutoff \il{\ol D} can be associated with a temperature  scale \il{k_b \ol T = \ol D}.
At temperatures sufficiently below this temperature (\il{T \ll \ol T}), the susceptibility becomes (again from perturbation theory)
\beq
\chi_d(T) = \fr{\Delta}{2\pi}\rr{\fr{g \mu_B}{\ol \epsilon_d}}^2 + \fr{1}{4T}\qq{1+\hf\ex{\fr{T^*}{T}}}^{-1}
\eeq
For temperatures sufficiently low, which we demarcate by a temperature \il{T_{FL}}, the denominator in the second term will be sufficiently large so that we can ignore that term with respect to the first term:
\beq
T \gg T_{FL} \implies e^\fr{T^*}{T} \gg 1 \implies \qq{1+\hf\ex{\fr{T^*}{T}}}^{-1} \approx 0 
\eeq
The susceptibility in this low temperature range can thus be written as
\beq[sakura]
\chi_d = \fr{\Delta}{2\pi}\rr{\fr{g \mu_B}{\ol \epsilon_d}}^2
\eeq
This is analogous to the  result obtained in eq.~\ref{mimp}, from the mean field version of the Fermi liquid theory, and also obtained from a renormalized perturbation theory of Anderson model.
To see how, note that since we are in the limit \il{\avg{n_d} = 0}, the onsite repulsion term \il{U} can be dropped because there is no probability of double occupation.
Eq.~\ref{mimp} then becomes
\beq[sasuke]
\chi_d = \fr{g^2 \mu_B^2}{2} \rho_d(0) = \fr{g^2 \mu_B^2}{2} \fr{\Delta}{\pi}\fr{1}{\ol \epsilon_d^2 + \Delta^2}
\eeq
Next note that we had assumed at the beginning that \il{\epsilon_d^* \gg \Delta}.
We need to find the relative order difference between \il{\ol \epsilon_d} and \il{\Delta}.
From eq.~\ref{eraser}, we can drop the \il{\pi} and \il{a} because they are of order 1.
\beq
\ol \epsilon_d = \epsilon_d^* - \Delta \ln \fr{\ol \epsilon_d}{\Delta}
\eeq
Dividing through by \il{\Delta} and defining \il{x_1 = \fr{\ol \epsilon_d}{\Delta}, x_2 = \fr{\epsilon_d^*}{\Delta}}, we get
\beq
x_1 + \ln x_1 = x_2
\eeq
Since \il{O(\ln x_1) \leq O(x_1)}, we can write
\begin{gather}
O(x_1) = O(x_2)\\
\implies O\rr{\fr{\ol \epsilon_d}{\Delta}} = O\rr{\fr{\epsilon_d^*}{\Delta}}\\
\implies O\rr{\ol \epsilon_d} = O\rr{\epsilon_d^*}\\
\end{gather}
Since \il{\ol \epsilon_d} and \il{\epsilon_d^*} are of the same order, we can say:
\beq
\epsilon_d^* \gg \Delta \implies \ol \epsilon_d \gg \Delta
\eeq
Applying this to eq.~\ref{sasuke} means
\beq
\chi_d \approx \fr{g^2 \mu_B^2}{2} \fr{\Delta}{\pi}\fr{1}{\ol \epsilon_d^2}
\eeq
which is the same as eq.~\ref{sakura}.
This tells us that scaling all the way down to very low temperatures in regime \il{\epsilon_d^* \gg \Delta} brings us into a Fermi liquid state, characterized by a temperature-independent susceptibility (as is standard in a Fermi liquid).
The crossovers can be seen by looking at the variation of the Curie constant \il{\chi T}.\\\\
Since the susceptibility is proportional to the magnetic moment, presence of degeneracy will reduce this moment because the probability of occupying the states will decrease.
As a result, the Curie constant is also a measure of the effective degeneracy of the impurity orbital.
At very high temperatures \il{T \gg U,\epsilon_d}, all the impurity levels \il{0,\epsilon_d} and \il{2\epsilon_d + U} will become degenerate on energy scales of the order of \il{k_B T}.
As a result, the Curie constant is approximately \il{\fr{1}{8}} in this range.
The impurity occupancy is \il{n_d = 1}, because there are 4 degenerate states and the average number of electrons on them is 1.
At lower temperatures \il{U \gg T \gg T^*}, the degeneracy gets lowered; now, only the vacant and single-occupied states are degenerate.
Here the Curie constant is \il{\fr{1}{6}}.
In this case, the average occupancy is \il{n_d = \fr{0+1+1}{3} = \fr{2}{3}}.
At still lower temperatures, we saw that the impurity becomes vacant and \il{n_d = 0}.
The Curie constant becomes linear in temperature, going down to 0.
More formally,
\beq[suscep]
m = \fr{1}{\beta}\pd{\ln Z}{B} \implies \chi = \lim_{B \to 0}\pd{m}{B} = \lim_{B \to 0}\fr{1}{Z^2\beta}\qq{Z\fr{\partial^2 Z}{\partial B^2} - \rr{\pd{Z}{B}}^2}
\eeq
For the case of four-fold degeneracy, all the states can be assumed to be at zero energy.
Then, under a magnetic field B (\il{h=\fr{g\mu_B}{2}B}), the partition function is
\begin{gather}
Z = 1 + \ex{\beta h} + \ex{-\beta h} + 1 = 2\rr{1+\cosh \beta h}\\
\implies \pd{Z}{B} = g \mu_B \beta \sinh \beta h\\
\implies \fr{\partial^2 Z}{\partial B^2} = \hf\rr{g \mu_B}^2 \beta^2 \cosh \beta h
\end{gather}
Since \il{\lim_{h \to 0} \sinh \beta h = 0} and \il{\lim_{h \to 0} \cosh \beta h = 1}, we get
\begin{gather}
\chi = \fr{\beta g^2 \mu_B^2}{2 Z(h=0)}
\end{gather}
Setting \il{g \mu_B = k_B = 1}, we get
\beq[suscdeg]
\chi T =\fr{1}{2\mc{D}}
\eeq
where \il{Z(h=0) = 2 + 2 = 4 = \mc{D}} is the degeneracy.
\\\\
Similarly, for the triplet case (\il{\epsilon_d} and 0 are degenerate while \il{U \gg T}), the doubly occupied case is essentially cut off from the available states, so \il{Z = 1 + 2\cosh \beta h}.
The proof again goes through similarly.
But this time, we have \il{Z(h=0) = 1 + 2 = 3 = \mc{D}}.\\\\
For \il{\epsilon_d = k_B T^* > k_B T} such that \il{k_B T^* \gg \Delta}, we can find the magnetic moment in a perturbative fashion.
At the zeroth order, we can neglect the hybridisation \il{\Delta}.
Then,
\beq
m^{(0)} = \fr{1}{\beta}\pd{\ln Z(h)}{B}
\eeq
where
\beq
Z(h) = 1 + e^{-\beta\rr{k_B T^* -h}}+ e^{-\beta\rr{k_B T^* +h}} = 1 + e^{-\fr{\beta}{\beta^*}}2\cosh \beta h
\eeq
Therefore,
\beq
\chi^{(0)} = \lim_{h \to 0} \fr{1}{\beta Z}\fr{\partial^2 Z}{\partial B^2} = \lim_{h \to 0} \fr{g^2 \mu_B^2}{4 \beta Z}\fr{\partial^2 Z}{\partial h^2} = \fr{g^2 \mu_B^2}{4}\beta \fr{2e^{-\fr{\beta}{\beta^*}}}{1 + 2e^{-\fr{\beta}{\beta^*}}}
\eeq
Again setting \il{g \mu_B = k_B = 1}, we get,
\beq
\chi^{(0)} = \fr{1}{4 T} \fr{2e^{-\fr{\beta}{\beta^*}}}{1 + 2e^{-\fr{\beta}{\beta^*}}} = \fr{1}{4 T} \fr{2}{e^{\fr{\beta}{\beta^*}} + 2} 
\eeq
As a first approximation, we can include the hybridisation by using the expression for the average number of spin up or spin down impurity as obtained from the non-interacting treatment, eq.~\ref{total}
\beq
m^{(1)} =\fr{g \mu_B}{2}\rr{ n_\ua - n_\da} = \fr{g \mu_B}{2\pi}\qq{\tan^{-1}\fr{\Delta}{k_B T^* - h} - \tan^{-1}\fr{\Delta}{k_B T^* + h}}
\eeq
Since \il{\Delta \ll T^*}, we can expand the arctan in a Taylor series.
Up to first order, we get
\beq
m^{(1)} = \fr{g \mu_B}{2\pi}\qq{\fr{\Delta}{k_B T^* - h} - \fr{\Delta}{k_B T^* + h}} = \fr{g \mu_B \Delta}{\pi}\fr{h}{k_B \rr{T^*}^2 - h^2}
\eeq
Differentiating with \il{B} gives
\beq
\chi^{(1)} = \lim_{h \to 0} \pd{m^{(1)}}{B} = \fr{g^2\mu_B^2}{2}\fr{\Delta}{\pi}\fr{1}{k_B^2 {T^*}^2} = \fr{\Delta}{2\pi {T^*}^2}
\eeq
Combining the zeroth and first order terms, the susceptibility in the regime \il{T \lesssim T^*} is
\beq
\chi = \fr{1}{4 T} \fr{2}{e^{\fr{\beta}{\beta^*}} + 2}  + \fr{\Delta}{2\pi {T^*}^2}
\eeq
Below some temperature \il{T_\text{FL} \ll T^*}, the susceptibility reduces to
\begin{gather}
\chi \approx \fr{1}{4 T} \fr{2}{e^{\fr{\beta}{\beta^*}}} + \fr{\Delta}{2\pi {T^*}^2} \approx\fr{\Delta}{2\pi {T^*}^2}\\
\implies \chi T \propto T
\end{gather}
We can now visualize the various phases as the temperature is changed.
For \il{T \gg U,\epsilon_d}, all the four states states \il{\ket{0},\ket{\ua},\ket{\da},\ket{2}} are degenerate (\il{\mc D = 4}), the average occupancy is \il{\avg{n_d} = \fr{0+1+1+2}{4}=1} and the effective Curie constant is \il{\fr{1}{2\mc D} = \fr{1}{8}}.
At lower temperatures \il{U \gg T \gg T^*}, the level \il{\ket{2}} is disconnected from the conduction band and the three remaining states are now degenerate (\il{\mc D = 3}).
The average occupancy becomes \il{\fr{0+1+1}{3} = \fr{2}{3}} and the effective Curie constant is now \il{\fr{1}{2\times 3} = \fr{1}{6}}.
At still lower temperatures \il{T^* \gg T}, the singly-occupied levels become disconnected and thee impurity occupancy becomes 0.
The effective Curie constant in this regime is linear in \il{T}.

Next we consider the mixed valence regime, described by \il{|\epsilon_d^*| < \Delta}.
It is clear that since the impurity level is within an interval of the hybridisation from the Fermi surface, the charge fluctuations can cause transitions between the various states of the impurity.
This means that the occupation number of the impurity site is not a good quantum number in this regime, and the average number of impurity electrons will be fractional.
This definition is a bit arbitrary because any observed sample will display an eigenstate in which the impurity states have contributions from both \il{\avg{n_d}=0} and \il{\avg{n_d}=1}, so any sample will be mixed in that sense.
However, if we are not in the mixed valence regime (\il{|\epsilon_d| \gg \Delta}), then the contribution from any one state will far outweigh the other.
If \il{\epsilon_d > 0}, then the impurity level is far above the Fermi level and it will most probably not be occupied and the majority of the contribution will come from \il{\avg{n_d} = 0}.
Similarly, if \il{\epsilon_d < 0}, then the impurity level is far below the Fermi level and the average occupation will be close to 1.
The regime of mixed valence is one in which these two contributions are comparable.
\\\\
\begin{figure} \includegraphics[scale=0.29]{mixed.png}\caption{Renormalization in energy levels when \il{|\epsilon_d^*| \lesssim \Delta}} \end{figure}
Since we have \il{|\epsilon_d^*| \lesssim \Delta}, as we renormalize, the decreasing cutoff will first match \il{\Delta} or \il{k_B T}, whichever is greater.
From eq.~\ref{mirai2}, we know that if \il{D} comes close to \il{\Delta}, our analysis will break down because we can no longer ignore that term.
Since that term represents the broadening of the impurity level, this same broadening can also be brought about by the thermal fluctuations which are of the scale \il{k_B T}.
This means that real valence fluctuations will now renormalize the potential \il{V_{kd}}.
Hence, our analysis will stop at \il{D = \text{max}\cc{\Delta, k_B T}}.
For the simpler situation in which \il{T = 0}, the renormalization will stop at \il{D = \Delta}.
From eq.~\ref{const}, putting \il{D = \Delta}, we get
\beq
\rr{\epsilon_d}_\text{MV} = \epsilon_d^*
\eeq
This is the renormalized impurity level in the mixed valence regime.
A characteristic feature of this regime is that the charge fluctuations can be thermally excited.
This can be seen as follows.
The probability of  a transition from, say, \il{\ket{n_d = 0}} to \il{\ket{n_d = 1}} is
\beq
\sim \fr{k_B T}{\epsilon_d}
\eeq
Assuming the thermal fluctuations are more or less of the order \il{\Delta}, for \il{\epsilon_d \gg \Delta}, this transition will not be possible.
However, in the mixed valence regime, because \il{\epsilon_d \sim \Delta}, these excitations do occur.
These fluctuations, as well as the ones from the hybridisation with the conduction band, are responsible for the mixing of the singly-occupied and null-occupied states.\\\\
The crossovers in the mixed valence regime are as follows.
Similar to the previous case, at high and intermediate temperatures, we have \il{n_d = 1} and \il{n_d = \fr{2}{3}} respectively.
However, while the triplet degeneracy lasted upto \il{T \sim T^*} in the previous case, here it continues up to \il{T \sim \Delta} because that is where the scaling breaks down.
That is, \il{T = \Delta} is the point where we can no longer ignore the renormalization in \il{V} and it begins to increase with scaling.
Beyond this point, the impurity occupation remains fractional and not much else can be said.
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{50pt}
\il{n_d = 1}\\\il{\chi T = \fr{1}{8}}\\\il{T\gg U}
\end{minipage}
\hspace*{20pt}\il{\Longrightarrow}\hspace*{20pt}
\begin{minipage}{50pt}
\il{n_d = \fr{2}{3}}\\\il{\chi T = \fr{1}{6}}\\\il{T\gg \Delta}
\end{minipage}
\hspace*{20pt}\il{\Longrightarrow}\hspace*{20pt}
\begin{minipage}{50pt}
	\il{n_d = \text{fractional}}\\\il{\chi T \propto T}\\\il{T\ll \Delta}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
For \il{\epsilon_d^* \ll -\Delta}, the scaling will stop when the impurity level again goes out of the Fermi surface.
But this time, it goes out from below.
This again decouples the singly-occupied state from the conduction band and the scaling stops.
This happens at say \il{\wl D = -\wl {\epsilon_d} = \wl {T}}.
Since the singly-occupied impurity level is now well below \il{-D}, we have \il{\avg{n_d} = 1} and we are comfortably in the Kondo limit and the SWT and a consequent poor man's scaling can be performed, which will give eqs.~\ref{historia} through \ref{jean2}.
The resulf of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation is a Hamiltonian that couples the impurity to the conduction electrons only through their spins; their is no charge fluctuation.
At high temperatures \il{T \gg T_K}, the impurity is essentially decoupled and we get a susceptibility of the form eq.~\ref{suscdeg}, but with a degeneracy of 2.
To go to lower temperatures, we can do a Poor Man's scaling which suggests that the Hamiltonian at \il{T\ll T_K} is one with a large coupling between the impurity and the conduction electrons.

\begin{minipage}{50pt}

\subsubsection*{Jefferson's calculation}
Jefferson did a slightly more rigorous calculation to obtain the scaling equation.
He divided the Hamiltonian into two parts
\beq
H = \sum_{k\sigma}\epsilon_{k\sigma} n_{k\sigma} + \epsilon_d n_d + \sum_{k\sigma} \rr{V^-_{kd}c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c_{d\sigma} + V^+_{kd}c^\dagger_{d\sigma}c_{k\sigma}} = H_0 + V
\eeq
Before scaling, \il{V^+ = V^- = V}.
The Schrodinger equation we want to solve is
\beq
H \psi = E \psi
\eeq
We know the eigenstates \il{\psi_0} of \il{H_0}.
They are the states \il{\{\ket{n_{k_i\sigma},n_{d\sigma^\prime}}\}}.
These states of course span the entire Hilbert space.
A subset of these states form the model subspace.
We call these states \il{\phi}.
For our case, that is the subspace with all conduction electrons inside \il{D - \delta D}.
The projection operator for this subspace is 
\beq
P = \sum \ket{\phi}\bra{\phi} =  \sum_{|k|<D-\delta D, \sigma=\pm 1, n_{d\sigma}=0,1} \ket{n_{k\sigma},n_{d\sigma^\prime}}
\eeq
Its orthogonal subspace has a projection operator
\beq
Q = 1 - P = \sum_{D-\delta D < |k| < D, \sigma=\pm 1, n_{d\sigma}=0,1} \ket{n_{k\sigma},n_{d\sigma^\prime}}
\eeq
If the dimension of model subspace if \il{d}, we can say that \il{P} takes \il{d} eigenstates \il{\psi} of the total Hamiltonian to \il{d} eigenstates in the model subspace:
\beq
P \{\psi\}_d = \{\phi\}
\eeq
This is of course true in the non-interacting limit.
There, the \il{\psi_0} are the exact eigenstates, and the action of \il{P} is basically
\beq
P \psi_0\bigg\vert_{|k|<D-\delta D} = \psi_0\bigg\vert_{|k|<D-\delta D}
\eeq
Now, as we turn on the interactions adiabatically, it is safe to assume that these \il{d} non-interacting eigenstates flow into \il{d} interacting eigenstates.
This means that we can define an inverse for the \il{P} operator which takes a non-interacting eigenstate from the model subspace into the interacting eigenstate:
\beq
\Omega \{\phi\} = \{\psi\}
\eeq
Since \il{\Omega} can only act on states in the model subspace, we define
\beq
\Omega \{\phi\}^\perp = 0
\eeq
This allows us to write
\begin{gather}
\Omega P \phi = \Omega \phi\\
\Omega P \phi^\perp = \Omega \times 0 = 0  = \Omega \phi^\perp
\end{gather}
In the first equation, I used \il{P \phi = \phi} because the projection of \il{\phi} into the model subspace is \il{\phi} itself.
Together these two identities give
\beq[hikki]
\Omega P = \Omega
\eeq
With these definitions, we now change the problem a bit.
We want to solve the Schrodinger equation only in the model subspace.
To this end we write the Schrodinger equation as
\beq
H \Omega \phi = E \Omega \Phi \\
\eeq
Since we want to write down an equation only in the model subspace, the equation should operate only on the \il{\phi}.
To remove the \il{\Omega} on the right side, operate on this equation with \il{P} from the left.
This gives
\beq
P H \Omega \phi = E P \Omega \phi = E \phi\\
\eeq
This is the effective Schrodinger equation in the model subspace.
The effective Hamiltonian for the model subspace is
\beq[yuigahama]
H_\text{eff} = PH\Omega  = PH_0 P + PV\Omega = P H_0 P + PV\Omega
\eeq
To solve for the \il{\Omega}, apply eq.~\ref{hikki} on the Schrodinger equation \il{(E - H_0)\psi =V \psi}:
\beq
\Omega V\psi = (E \Omega P - \Omega P H_0)\psi
\eeq
Now, since \il{P} is made up of the eigenstates of \il{H_0}, those two will commute: \il{\qq{H_0, P} = 0}.
The equation then becomes
\beq
\Omega V\psi = (E - \Omega H_0 P)\psi
\eeq
Subtracting the Schrodinger equation from the last equation gives
\beq
\rr{\Omega - 1} V\psi &= \rr{H_0 - \Omega H_0 P}\psi\\
\implies \rr{\Omega - 1} V \Omega \phi &= \rr{H_0 - \Omega H_0 P}\Omega \phi\\
\implies \rr{\Omega - 1} V \Omega \phi &= \rr{H_0 \Omega - \Omega H_0} \phi\\
\implies \rr{\Omega - 1} V \Omega &= \qq{H_0, \Omega}
\eeq
This is the main equation.
To make progress, we expand the operator \il{\Omega} in powers of the interaction \il{V}:
\beq
\Omega = \sum_n c_n V^n = \sum_n \Lambda_n
\eeq
The zeroth term in the main equation becomes
\beq
\qq{H_0, \Lambda_0} = 0 \implies \Lambda_0 = P
\eeq
The first order equation is
\beq
\qq{H_0, \Lambda_1} = \rr{\Lambda_0 - 1}V\Lambda_0 = \rr{P - 1}VP = -QVP
\eeq
The second order equation is
\beq
\qq{H_0, \Lambda_2} = -V\Lambda_1 + \Lambda_0 V \Lambda_1 + \Lambda_1 V \Lambda_0 = -QV\Lambda_1 + \Lambda_1 V P
\eeq
These equations are of the form \il{\qq{H_0, \Lambda_n} = A_n}, where \il{A_n} is an operator in terms of \il{\Lambda_{n-1}} and lower orders.
\begin{gather}
A_1 = -QVP\\
A_2 = -QV\Lambda_1 + \Lambda_1 V P
\end{gather}
Let \il{\ket{l}} and \il{\ket{h}} belong to the model subspace and its orthogonal subspace respectively.
Then, taking matrix element between \il{\bra{h}} and \il{\ket{l}} of the general form equation gives
\beq
\bra{h} A_n \ket{l} = \rr{E_h - E_l}\bra{h}\Lambda_n \ket{l} \implies \bra{h}\Lambda_n \ket{l} = \fr{\bra{h} A_n \ket{l}}{E_h - E_l}
\eeq
If we define an operator \il{S} by its action on a general operator A as
\beq
\bra{h}S A \ket{l} = \fr{\bra{h} A \ket{l}}{E_l - E_h}
\eeq
we can write the solution
\beq
\Lambda_n = -S(A_n)
\eeq
The expression of \il{SA} can be written as
\beq
SA &= \sum_{h,l}\ket{h}\bra{l} \fr{\bra{h}A\ket{l}}{E_l - E_H} \\
   &= \sum_{h,l}\fr{1}{E_l - E_h}\ket{h}\bra{h}A\ket{l}\bra{l}\\
   &= \sum_{l}\fr{1}{E_l - H_0}\rr{\sum_h \ket{h}\bra{h}}A\ket{l}\bra{l}\\
   &= \sum_l G_l A P_l
\eeq
where \il{P_l = \ket{l}\bra{l}} and \il{G_l = \fr{1}{E_l - H_0}Q}.\\\\
\il{S} has the property
\beq
\bra{h}S QA \ket{l} &= \fr{\bra{h}Q A \ket{l}}{E_l - E_h} = \fr{\bra{h}A \ket{l}}{E_l - E_h} = \bra{h}SA\ket{l} \\
\implies S(QA) &= S(A)
\eeq
The lowest order solutions are thus
\begin{gather}
	\Lambda_1 = S(QVP) = S(VP)\\
	\Lambda_2 = S(QV\Lambda_1) - S(\Lambda_1 V P) = S(VS(VP)) - S(S(VP)VP)
\end{gather}
We can now expand the effective Hamiltonian in powers of \il{V}.
From eq.~\ref{yuigahama}, the interacting part of the effective Hamiltonian becomes
\beq
H_\text{eff} - P H_0 P &= P V\Omega \\
		       &\approx PV(\Lambda_0 + \Lambda_1 + \Lambda_2)\\
				   &= PV\qq{P + S(VP) + S(VS(VP)) - S(S(VP)VP)}\\
				   &= PVP + PVS(VP) + PVS(VS(VP)) - PVS(S(VP)VP)
\eeq
Therefore,
\beq
H_\text{eff} = PHP + PVS(VP) + PVS(VS(VP)) - PVS(S(VP)VP)
\eeq
The first term is the obvious lowest approximation; you just project the entire Hamiltonian into the model subspace.
 The second term is
\beq
PVSVP = PV \sum_l G_l V P P_l = PV \sum_l G_l V P_l
\eeq
where I used \il{P P_l = \sum_{l^\prime} \ket{l^\prime}\bra{l^\prime} \ket{l}\bra{l} = \sum_{l^\prime}\ket{l^\prime}\bra{l^\prime}\delta_{ll^\prime} = P_l}.
The third term becomes
\beq
PVSVSVP  = PVSV \sum_l G_l V P_l = PV\sum_l S V G_l V P_l \\
= PV\sum_{l,l^\prime} G_{l^\prime} V G_l V P_lP_{l^\prime} = PV \sum_l  G_{l} V G_l V P_l
\eeq
The fourth term is
\beq
PVS(S(VP)VP) = PVS(\sum_l G_l VP P_l VP) = PV \sum_{l,l^\prime} G_{l^\prime} G_l VP_l VP P_{l^\prime} \\
= PV \sum_{l^\prime} G_{l^\prime} \rr{\sum_l G_l VP_l} V P_{l^\prime}
\eeq
The effective Hamiltonian up to third order in \il{V} is
\beq
H_\text{eff} = PH_0 P + PV \sum_l G_l V P_l + PV \sum_l  G_{l} V G_l V P_l \\
- PV \sum_{l,l^\prime} G_{l^\prime} G_l VP_l V P_{l^\prime}
\eeq
These results have been more or less general.
We now need to write these in terms of the creation and annihilation operators of our Hamiltonian.
The model subspace for our problem is the part of the conduction band up to \il{D - \delta D}.
Here on, \il{\sum} represent sum over the model subspace momenta and \il{\sum^\prime} represent sum over the remaining momenta.
To facilitate writing the effective Hamiltonian in terms of the creation and annihilation operators, we change the projection operators from the bra-ket representation to operator representation:
\begin{gather}
	\ket{k_1}\bra{k_2} = c^\dagger_{k_1}c_{k_2} \\
	P_k = \ket{k,n_{d\sigma}}\bra{k,n_{d\sigma}} = c^\dagger_{k}c_{k}c^\dagger_{d\sigma}c_{d\sigma} = n_{k\sigma}n_{d\sigma}
\end{gather}
The first term becomes
\beq
P H_0 P = \sum_{k\sigma} \epsilon_{k\sigma} n_{k\sigma} + \epsilon_d n_d + \sum_{k\sigma}\rr{V_{kd} c^\dagger_{k\sigma} c_{d\sigma} + \text{h.c.}}
\eeq
The second term involves two potential terms that scatter from the model subspace to the high energy subspace and then back to the model subspace.
Hence this term is 
\beq
PV \sum_l G_l V P_l  &= V \sum_{q\sigma}\rr{\fr{V_q}{\epsilon_d - \epsilon_q} c^\dagger_{q\sigma}c_{d\sigma} + \fr{V^*_q}{\epsilon_q - \epsilon_d} c^\dagger_{d\sigma}c_{q\sigma}}\\
		     &= {\sum_{q\sigma}}^+\fr{|V_q|^2 c^\dagger_{d\sigma}c_{q\sigma} c^\dagger_{q\sigma}c_{d\sigma}}{\epsilon_d - \epsilon_q} + {\sum_{q\sigma}}^-\fr{|V_q|^2c^\dagger_{q\sigma}c_{d\sigma}c^\dagger_{d\sigma}c_{q\sigma}}{\epsilon_q - \epsilon_d}\\
		     &= {\sum_{q\sigma}}^+\fr{|V_q|^2 n_{d\sigma}\rr{1-n_{q\sigma}}}{\epsilon_d - \epsilon_q} + {\sum_{q\sigma}}^-\fr{|V_q|^2n_{q\sigma}\rr{1-n_{d\sigma}}}{\epsilon_q - \epsilon_d}\\
\eeq
In the high energy subspaces, \il{n_q^+ = 1-n_q^- = 0}.
Therefore,
\beq
PV \sum_l G_l V P_l  &= {\sum_q}^+\fr{|V_q|^2 n_{d\sigma}}{\epsilon_d - \epsilon_q} + {\sum_q}^-\fr{|V_q|^2\rr{1-n_{d\sigma}}}{\epsilon_q - \epsilon_d} \\
		     &= n_d \rr{{\sum_q}^+\fr{|V_q|^2 }{\epsilon_d - \epsilon_q} + 2{\sum_q}^-\fr{|V_q|^2}{\epsilon_d - \epsilon_q}}\\
		     &= n_d \delta \epsilon_d
\eeq
The third term is zero in our case.
The part \il{G_l V G_l V} will do the following.

\beq
\ket{k,n_{d\sigma}} \ra \begin{cases} \ket{q_e,n_d=0} \ra \begin{cases} \ket{q_e,n_d=1}\\\ket{q_e,q^\prime_h,n_d = 1} \end{cases}
\\ 
\ket{q_h,n_d=1} \ra \begin{cases} \ket{q_h,q^\prime_e,n_d=0} \\ \ket{q_h,n_d=0} \end{cases}
\end{cases} 
\eeq
None of the four final states belong to the model subspace, so this term is zero.\\\\
The fourth term involves a first scattering between two model states, followed by a scattering to a high energy subspace and then a scattering back to the model subspace.
One way for going through such a process is
\beq
\ket{k,n_d = 0} \underbrace{\ra \ket{n_d=1} \ra}_{\Delta E = \epsilon_k - \epsilon_q} \ket{q_e,n_d = 0} \underbrace{\ra}_{\Delta E = \epsilon_q - \epsilon_d} \ket{k^\prime, n_d = 1}
\eeq
Another way is to start with \il{c_d} instead of \il{c^\dagger_d} 
\beq
\ket{n_{d\sigma} = 1} \underbrace{\ra \ket{k\sigma,n_d=0} \ra}_{\Delta E = \epsilon_k - \epsilon_q} \begin{cases} \ket{q_h\ua, n_{d\ua} = 1}\\ \ket{q_h\da, n_{d\da} = 1} \end{cases} \underbrace{\ra}_{\Delta E = \epsilon_q - \epsilon_d} \ket{n_d = 0}
\eeq
Combining the two processes gives

\beq
{\sum_{q}}^+\sum_{k\sigma} \fr{|V_q|^2c^\dagger_{d\sigma}c_{q\sigma}c^\dagger_{q\sigma}c_{d\sigma}c^\dagger_{d\sigma}c_{k\sigma}}{(\epsilon_q - \epsilon_d)(\epsilon_k - \epsilon_q)} + {\sum_{q\sigma^\prime}}^-\sum_{k\sigma} \fr{|V_q|^2c^\dagger_{q\sigma^\prime}c_{d\sigma^\prime}c^\dagger_{d\sigma^\prime}c_{q\sigma^\prime}c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c_{d\sigma}}{(\epsilon_q - \epsilon_d)(\epsilon_k - \epsilon_q)}\\
=\sum_{k\sigma}\rr{c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c_{d\sigma} \delta V^-_k + c^\dagger_{d\sigma}c_{k\sigma}\delta V^-_k}
\eeq
where
\beq
\delta V^+ = {\sum_q}^+ \fr{|V_q|^2}{(\epsilon_q - \epsilon_d)(\epsilon_k - \epsilon_q)}\\
\delta V^- = {\sum_q}^- 2\fr{|V_q|^2}{(\epsilon_q - \epsilon_d)(\epsilon_k - \epsilon_q)}
\eeq
The total Hamiltonian can be written in the form
\beq
H_\text{eff} = \sum_{k\sigma}\epsilon_{k\sigma} n_{k\sigma} + &\rr{\epsilon_d + \delta \epsilon_d}n_d \\
												     + &\sum_{k\sigma}\cc{\rr{V^-_k + \delta V^-_k} c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c_{d\sigma} + \rr{V^+_k + \delta V^+_k} c^\dagger_{d\sigma}c_{k\sigma}}
\eeq
We now evaluate the changes:
\beq
\delta \epsilon_d &= \rr{{\sum_q}^+\fr{|V_q|^2 }{\epsilon_d - \epsilon_q} + 2{\sum_q}^-\fr{|V_q|^2}{\epsilon_d - \epsilon_q}} \\
&\approx |V|^2 \rho |\delta D| \rr{\fr{1}{\epsilon_d - D} + \fr{2}{\epsilon_d + D}}\\
&=|V|^2 \rho |\delta D|\fr{D - 3\epsilon_d}{D^2 - \epsilon_d^2}
\eeq
I used the approximation
\beq
\sum_{q=D-\delta D}^D f(q) = \int_{D- \delta D}^D dE \rho(E) f(E) \approx \rho f(D) \delta D
\eeq
Also,
\beq
\delta V_k^+ &= {\sum_q}^+ \fr{|V_q|^2}{(\epsilon_q - \epsilon_d)(\epsilon_k - \epsilon_q)}\\
	       &\approx |V|^2 \rho |\delta D|\fr{1}{(D - \epsilon_d)(\epsilon_k - D)}\\
\delta V_k^- &= 2{\sum_q}^- \fr{|V_q|^2}{(\epsilon_q - \epsilon_d)(\epsilon_k - \epsilon_q)}\\
	       &\approx -|V|^2 \rho |\delta D|\fr{2}{(D + \epsilon_d)(\epsilon_k + D)}
\eeq
We now make the following assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \il{k} is close to the Fermi level (\il{\epsilon_k \approx 0})
	\item Because \il{k} is close to the Fermi surface, we assume the potential is independent of momenta: \il{V_k^+ \equiv v^+, V^-_k \equiv v^-}
	\item Since we truncated at third order, we need \il{D - |\epsilon_d| \gg v^\pm}.
This gives us \il{D \gg |\epsilon_d|}.
\end{itemize}
With these assumptions, we get the scaling equations similar to the ones obtained previously.

\pagebreak\section{URG Formalism}
We are given a Hamiltonian \il{\ham} which is not diagonal in a particular occupation number basis of the electrons, \il{\hat n_k}: \il{\qq{\ham,n_k} \neq 0}.
The goal is to obtain the unitary transformation \il{U_k} that diagonalizes this Hamiltonian in this particular basis:
\beq
\wl \ham = U_k \ham U^\dagger_k \text{  such that  } \qq{\wl \ham,n_k} = 0
\eeq
Another way to express the above problem is that, with the original Hamiltonian \il{\ham}, the diagonal terms are not zero:
\beq
n_k \ham(1-n_k) \neq 0
\eeq
so we want to find a rotated Hamiltonian \il{\wl \ham = U_k \ham U_k^\dagger} such that the off-diagonal term is zero:
\beq[solve]
n_k \wl \ham(1-n_k) =0
\eeq
To find the form for \il{U_k}, we define a few things.
First,
\beq
P_k = U_k^\dagger n_k U_k
\eeq
To get a feel for what \il{P_k} is, note that
\beq
\qq{\ham, P_k} = \qq{U^\dagger_k U_k \ham, U_k^\dagger n_k U_k} = U_k^\dagger \qq{\wl \ham, n_k}U_k = 0
\eeq
\il{P_k} is hence those degrees of freedom in which the given Hamiltonian \il{\ham} is diagonal.
Hence it is natural that they are obtained by rotating the \il{n_k}.
If we were to go to the eigenbasis of \ham, the form for \il{\wl \ham} will be 
\beq
\begin{pmatrix} E_1 & \\ & E_2 \end{pmatrix}
\eeq
while the form for \il{P_k} will be
\beq
\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0  \\ 0 & 0\end{pmatrix}
\eeq
It is obvious that
\beq
P_k^2 = P_k
\eeq
Another thing that we will define is
\beq
\ol \ham  = P_k \ham P_k
\eeq
\il{\ol \ham} is a matrix that, in the eigenbasis of \ham, has only the upper diagonal block of \il{\ham}.
 That is, you first form a matrix by keeping only the upper diagonal block of \il{\wl \ham} and then rotating to the basis of \il{n_k}.
Finally, let \il{\psi} be a wavefunction such that
\beq
P\psi = \psi
\eeq
This means that \il{\psi} is an eigenvector of \il{P_k} and hence also of \il{\ham} since \il{P_k} and \il{\ham} commute.
\\\\
Combining \il{P_k \ham = \ham P_k} and the idempotence of \il{P_k} gives
\beq
\ham P_k = P_k \ham = P_k \ham P_k = \ol\ham
\eeq
Operating this equation on \il{\psi} gives
\beq[tanjiro]
\ham \psi = \ol \ham \psi
\eeq
This is the equation we will use to find \il{U_k}.
But first we will write \il{\psi} in the following fashion:
\beq
\ket{\psi} = a_1 \ket{1,\psi_1} + a_0\ket{0,\psi_0}
\eeq
The first entry signifies whether the degree of freedom \il{k} is occupied or not, and the second entry is the wavefunction of the remaining degrees of freedom.
This is just a resolution of the total wavefunction in the two-dimensional Hilbert space of \il{k}.\\\\
We will also write the Hamiltonian \il{\ham} as
\beq[ham]
\ham = \ham^D + \ham^I + \ham^i 
\eeq
\il{\ham^D} is the diagonal part of the Hamiltonian, something of the form \il{\epsilon_k n_k}.
\il{\ham^I} is the interaction between the current degree of freedom \il{k} and the remaining degrees of freedom.
It will consist of terms like \il{c^\dagger_q c_k} or \il{c^\dagger_k c_q}.
The third term \il{\ham^i} has interactions between the remaining degrees of freedom.
This term will also be diagonal in \il{n_k} because it doesn't involve scattering of \il{k} states.
It will involve terms like \il{c^\dagger_{q_1}c_{q_2}}.
\\\\
\comm{
The Hamiltonian \il{\ol\ham} can also be decomposed in a similar form.
Note however that since it is already diagonal in \il{n_k}, it won't have any scattering in \il{k}, and hence won't have a term like \il{\ham^I}.
\beq
\ol \ham = \ol \ham^D + \ol \ham^i
\eeq}
Substituting the decomposition of \il{\ket{\psi}} and \ham into eq.~\ref{tanjiro} gives
\beq[zenitsu]
\ol \ham \rr{a_1\ket{1,\psi_1} + a_0\ket{0,\psi_0}} = \qq{\ham^D  + \ham^I + \ham^i }\rr{a_1 \ket{1,\psi_1} + a_0\ket{0,\psi_0}}
\eeq
To get expressions from this, note that on the left hand side, \il{\ol \ham} does not scatter \il{k}, so it will not change left entry in the kets; it can only change the right entries.
Similarly, on the right hand side, \il{\ham^D} and \il{\ham^i} will not change the occupation of the \il{k} degree of freedom.
\il{\ham^I} however \it{will} change it.
Matching the states with \il{\ket{0}} gives
\beq
\ol \ham a_0\ket{0,\psi_0} = \rr{\ham^D + \ham^i}a_0\ket{0,\psi_0} + \ham^Ia_1\ket{1,\psi_1}
\eeq
We can simplify this equation by noting that
\begin{gather}
\ham^D = \text{ Tr} \qq{\ham^D \hat n_k}\hat n_k + \text{ Tr} \qq{\ham^D (1 - \hat n_k)}(1-\hat n_k)\\
 \implies  \ham^D \ket{0,\psi_0} = \text{ Tr} \qq{\ham^D (1 - \hat n_k)}(1-\hat n_k)\ket{0,\psi_0}
\end{gather}
and
\begin{gather}
 \ham^I = \text{ Tr} \qq{c^\dagger_k \ham } c_k + c^\dagger_k \text{ Tr} \qq{\ham c_k}
 \implies \ham^I\ket{1,\psi_1} = \text{ Tr} \qq{c^\dagger_k \ham } c_k \ket{1,\psi_1}
\end{gather}
Substituting these in the equation gives
\begin{gather}
\ol \ham a_0\ket{0,\psi_0} = \cc{\text{ Tr} \qq{\ham^D (1 - \hat n_k)}(1-\hat n_k) + \ham^i}a_0\ket{0,\psi_0}
+ \text{ Tr} \qq{c^\dagger_k \ham } c_k a_1\ket{1,\psi_1}\\
\implies \cc{\ol\ham - \ham^i - \text{ Tr} \qq{\ham^D (1 - \hat n_k)}(1-\hat n_k)} a_0 \ket{0,\psi_0}
= \text{ Tr} \qq{c^\dagger_k \ham } c_k a_1\ket{1,\psi_1}
\end{gather}
Defining \il{\hat \omega = \ol\ham - \ham^i}, we get the result
\beq
a_0 \ket{0,\psi_0} = \qq{\hat \omega - \text{ Tr} \qq{\ham^D (1 - \hat n_k)}(1-\hat n_k)}^{-1}\text{ Tr} \qq{c^\dagger_k \ham } c_k a_1\ket{1,\psi_1}
\eeq
We define 
\beq[etadef]
\eta_k \equiv \fr{1}{\hat \omega - \text{ Tr} \qq{\ham^D (1 - \hat n_k)}(1-\hat n_k)}\text{ Tr} \qq{c^\dagger_k \ham } c_k
\eeq
which gives the equation a compact form
\beq
a_0 \ket{0,\psi_0} = \eta_k a_1\ket{1,\psi_1}
\eeq
The equation obtained by matching the states \il{\ket{1}} is
\beq
a_1 \ol \ham \ket{1,\psi_1} &= \rr{\ham^D + \ham^i}a_1\ket{1,\psi_1} + \ham^I a_0\ket{0,\psi_0}\\
			    &= \rr{\text{ Tr }\qq{\ham^D \hat n_k}\hat n_k + \ham^i}a_1\ket{1,\psi_1} + c^\dagger_k \text{ Tr }\qq{\ham c_k}a_0\ket{0,\psi_0}\\
\implies a_1 \ket{\psi_1} &= \rr{\ol\ham - \ham^i - \text{ Tr }\qq{\ham^D \hat n_k}\hat n_k }^{-1} c^\dagger_k \text{ Tr }\qq{\ham c_k}a_0\ket{0,\psi_0}\\
			  &=\eta_k^\dagger a_0\ket{0,\psi_0}
\eeq
where 
\beq[etadagdef]
\eta_k^\dagger = \fr{1}{\hat \omega - \text{ Tr} \qq{\ham^D \hat n_k}\hat n_k} c_k^\dagger \text{ Tr}\qq{ \ham c_k}
\eeq
We thus get the following two equations:
\begin{gather}
	a_0 \ket{0,\psi_0} = \eta_k a_1\ket{1,\psi_1}\label{eta}\\
	a_1 \ket{1,\psi_1} = \eta^\dagger_k a_0\ket{0,\psi_0}\label{etad}
\end{gather}
Combining eqs.~\ref{eta} and \ref{etad}, we get
\beq
a_0 \ket{0,\psi_0} = \eta_k a_1\ket{1,\psi_1} = \eta_k \eta_k^\dagger a_0 \ket{0,\psi_0}
\eeq
Combining this with the fact that \il{\eta^\dagger_k} should have a \il{c^\dagger_k} and hence should give \il{\eta^\dagger_k \ket{1,\psi_1}}, we get
\beq
\eta_k \eta^\dagger_k = 1 - \hat n_k
\eeq
Similarly, combining the equations the other way round gives
\beq[prod]
\eta_k^\dagger \eta_k = \hat n_k
\eeq
As a consequence,
\beq
 \cc{\eta_k,\eta^\dagger_k} &= 1\\
 \qq{\eta_k,\eta^\dagger_k} &= 1 - 2\hat n_k\\
\eeq
Other properties include
\begin{gather}
\eta_k^2 = \rr{\eta_k^\dagger}^2 = 0\\
\hat n_k \eta_k = (1-\hat n_k)\eta_k^\dagger = 0\\
\eta_k \hat n_k=\eta_k\\
\eta^\dagger(1-\hat n_k) = \eta^\dagger_k
\end{gather}
We now need to find the unitary operation \il{U_k} that disentangles the state \il{\ket{1,\psi_1}} from the state \il{\ket{psi}}.
Using eq.~\ref{eta},
\beq
\ket{\psi} = a_1\ket{1,\psi_1} + a_0\ket{0,\psi_0}  = a_1\ket{1,\psi_1} +  \eta_k a_1\ket{1,\psi_1} = \rr{1+\eta_k}\ket{1,\psi_1}
\eeq
This means that the operator \il{U_k} for going from \il{\ket{,\psi_1}} to \il{\ket{\psi}} is described by 
\beq[inv]
U_k^{-1} = \mc{C}\rr{1+ \eta_k + \mc{O}}
\eeq
where \il{\mc{O}} is some operator function of \il{\eta_k} and \il{\eta_k^\dagger} such that 
\beq
\rr{1 + \eta_k + \mc{O}}\ket{1,\psi_1} = \rr{1+\eta_k}\ket{1,\psi_1} \implies \mc{O}\ket{1,\psi_1} = 0
\eeq
and \il{\mc{C}} is a real scalar.
To find \il{\mc{O}}, note that we can write \il{U_k^{-1}} as 
\beq
U_k^{-1} = \mc{C} \ex{\eta_k + \mc{O}}
\eeq
This is because \il{\eta_k^2 = 0} and since \il{\mc{O}} is made up of \il{\eta_k} and \il{\eta_k^\dagger} is has the same property.
This exponential form allows us to write
\beq[u1]
U_k = \mc{C} \ex{-\eta_k - \mc{O}} = \mc{C}\rr{1 - \eta_k - \mc{O}}
\eeq
But, since \il{U_k} is required to be unitary, we can write, from eq.~\ref{inv},
\beq[u2]
U_k^\dagger = U_k^{-1} = \mc{C}\rr{1+\eta_k+\mc{O}} \implies U_k = \mc{C}\rr{1+\eta_k^\dagger + \mc{O}^\dagger}
\eeq
Comparing the two expression of \il{U_k} in eqs.~\ref{u1} and \ref{u2},
\beq
1 - \eta_k - \mc{O} = 1+\eta_k^\dagger + \mc{O}^\dagger \implies -\eta_k = \mc{O}^\dagger \implies \mc{O} = -\eta_k^\dagger
\eeq
This improves eq.~\ref{u1}:
\beq
U_k = \mc{C}\rr{1 + \eta_k^\dagger - \eta_k}
\eeq
To find \il{\mc{C}}, we can use the unitarity of \il{U_k}:
\beq
1 = U_k^\dagger U_k = \mc{C}^2\rr{1 + \cc{\eta_k^\dagger,\eta_k}} = \mc{C}^2\times 2 \implies \mc{C} = \fr{1}{\sqrt 2}
\eeq
The unitary operator that transforms the entangled eigenstate \il{\ket{\psi}} to the eigenstate with good quantum number \il{n_k}, \il{\ket{1,\psi_1}} is thus
\beq
U_k = \fr{1}{\sqrt 2}\rr{1 + \eta_k^\dagger - \eta_k}
\eeq
The form of the rotated Hamiltonian can now be written down.
\beq[roth]
 \wl\ham &= U_k \ham U_k^\dagger\\
	 &= \hf\rr{1+\eta_k^\dagger - \eta_k}\ham\rr{1 + \eta_k - \eta^\dagger_k}\\
				&= \hf\rr{1+\eta_k^\dagger - \eta_k}\rr{\ham + \ham\eta - \ham\eta_k^\dagger}\\
				&=\hf\rr{\ham+ \ham\eta - \ham\eta_k^\dagger + \eta_k^\dagger \ham + \eta_k^\dagger\ham\eta_k - \eta_k^\dagger \ham\eta_k^\dagger - \eta_k\ham - \eta_k \ham \eta_k + \eta_k \ham \eta_k^\dagger}\\
&=\hf\rr{\ham^D + \ham^i + \ham^I + \ham\eta - \ham\eta_k^\dagger + \eta_k^\dagger \ham + \eta_k^\dagger\ham\eta_k - \eta_k^\dagger \ham\eta_k^\dagger - \eta_k\ham - \eta_k \ham \eta_k + \eta_k \ham \eta_k^\dagger}\\
\eeq
In the last step I split \il{\ham} using eq.~\ref{ham}.
At this stage, note that terms that have two \il{\eta_k} or two \il{\eta_k^\dagger} can only be nonzero if the intervening \il{\ham} has a creation or destruction operator.
If we resolve the Hamiltonian in the basis of \il{k} in the following form:
\beq[hisoka]
 \ham &= \text{Tr}\qq{\ham \hat n_k}\hat n_k + \text{Tr}\qq{\ham \rr{1 - \hat n_k}}\rr{1 - \hat n_k} + c_k^\dagger \text{Tr}\qq{\ham c_k} + \text{Tr}\qq{c_k^\dagger \ham}c_k\\
      &=H_e \hat n_k + H_h (1-\hat n_k) + c^\dagger_k T + T^\dagger c_k
\eeq
Using this form, we can write
\beq[beats]
\eta_k \ham \eta_k = \eta_k c_k^\dagger  T \eta_k
\eeq
and
\beq[tora]
\eta_k^\dagger \ham\eta_k^\dagger = \eta_k^\dagger T^\dagger c_k \eta_k^\dagger
\eeq
To simplify this, note the following relation:
\beq[main]
\eta_k c_k^\dagger T \eta_k = T^\dagger  c_k
\eeq
To prove this, we will use eqs.~\ref{etadef} and ~\ref{etadagdef}.
\begin{gather}
\eta_k^\dagger = \fr{1}{\hat \omega - \text{ Tr} \qq{\ham^D \hat n_k}\hat n_k} c_k^\dagger T \\
\implies \rr{\hat \omega - \text{ Tr} \qq{\ham^D \hat n_k}\hat n_k}\eta_k^\dagger = c_k^\dagger T \\
\end{gather}
Taking the Hermitian conjugate gives
\beq[lulu]
\eta_k\rr{\hat \omega - \text{ Tr} \qq{\ham^D \hat n_k}\hat n_k} =  T^\dagger  c_k
\eeq
While taking the conjugate, I used the fact that \il{\hat \omega} is Hermitian:
\beq
 \hat \omega &= \ol \ham - \ham^i \\
	     &= P_k \ham P_k - \qq{H_e \hat n + H_h(1-\hat n) - \text{Tr }\qq{\ham \hat n_1 \hat n_2 ...
\hat n_N}\hat n_1 \hat n_2 ...
\hat n_N}
\eeq
From eq.~\ref{prod}, we get
\begin{gather}
\eta^\dagger_k \eta_k = \hat n \\
\implies \fr{1}{\hat \omega - \text{ Tr} \qq{\ham^D \hat n_k}\hat n_k} c_k^\dagger T  \eta_k = \hat n\\
\implies c_k^\dagger T  \eta_k = \rr{\hat \omega - \text{ Tr} \qq{\ham^D \hat n_k}\hat n_k}\hat n\\
\end{gather}
Multiplying with \il{\eta_k} from left and then using eq.~\ref{lulu} gives
\beq
\eta_k c_k^\dagger T  \eta_k =  T^\dagger  c_k
\eeq
This proves eq.~\ref{main}.
The Hermitian conjugate of the equation is
\beq[main2]
\eta_k^\dagger T^\dagger c_k\eta_k^\dagger = c_k^\dagger  T 
\eeq
Substituting eqs.~\ref{main} and \ref{main2} in eqs.~\ref{beats} and \ref{tora} gives
\beq[gon]
\eta_k \ham \eta_k + \eta_k^\dagger \ham \eta_k^\dagger = c_k^\dagger  T  + T^\dagger c_k
\eeq
Since \il{\ham^I} is the part of the Hamiltonian that causes scattering between \il{\ket{n_k=0}} and \il{\ket{n_k=1}}, we can write, from eq.~\ref{hisoka},
\beq[kill]
\ham^I = c_k^\dagger  T  +  T^\dagger c_k
\eeq
Comparing eqs.~\ref{gon} and \ref{kill}, we get
\beq
\ham^I - \eta_k \ham \eta_k - \eta_k^\dagger \ham \eta_k^\dagger = 0
\eeq
Substituting this in the rotated Hamiltonian gives
\beq
\wl \ham = \hf\rr{\ham^D + \ham^i + \ham\eta - \ham\eta_k^\dagger + \eta_k^\dagger \ham + \eta_k^\dagger\ham\eta_k - \eta_k\ham  + \eta_k \ham \eta_k^\dagger}
\eeq
To simplify the last 6 terms, we note the following:
\begin{gather}
 \eta_k^\dagger = \fr{1}{\ol H - H_e \hat n_k}c^\dagger_k T,\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \eta_k = \fr{1}{\ol H - H_h (1-\hat n_k)}T^\dagger c_k
 \end{gather}
 Then,
 \beq
 \implies& \fr{1}{\ol H - H_e \hat n_k}c^\dagger_k T= c^\dagger_kT\fr{1}{\ol H - H_h (1-\hat n_k)}\\
 \implies& c_k^\dagger T H_h(1-\hat n_k) = H_e \hat n_k c_k^\dagger T\\
 \implies& \fr{1}{\ol H - H_e \hat n_k}c_k^\dagger T H_h(1-\hat n_k) = \fr{1}{\ol H - H_e \hat n_k}H_e \hat n_k c_k^\dagger T\\
 \implies& \eta_k^\dagger H_h(1-\hat n_k) = H_e \hat n_k \fr{1}{\ol H - H_e \hat n_k}c_k^\dagger T\\
 \implies& \eta_k^\dagger H_h(1-\hat n_k) = H_e \hat n_k \eta_k^\dagger\\
 \implies& \eta_k^\dagger H_h = H_e \hat \eta_k^\dagger\label{iden}
\eeq
Using this identity and its conjugate (\il{\eta_k H_e = H_h \hat \eta_k}), the expression for \il{\eta_k H \eta_k^\dagger} can be simplified:
\beq
 \eta_k \ham \eta_k^\dagger &= \eta_k H_e \hat n_k \eta_k^\dagger\\
			    &= H_h \eta_k \eta_k^\dagger\\
			    &= H_h (1-\hat n_k)
\eeq
Similarly,
\beq
 \eta_k^\dagger  \ham \eta_k&= \eta_k^\dagger  H_h \eta_k\\
			    & = H_e \eta_k^\dagger \eta_k\\
			    &= H_e \hat n_k
\eeq
Also, 
\beq
\ham\eta - \ham\eta_k^\dagger + \eta_k^\dagger \ham - \eta_k\ham = \rr{\eta^\dagger_k H_h - H_e \eta_k^\dagger} + \rr{H_h \eta - \eta H_e} + \eta_k^\dagger T^\dagger c_k - \eta_k c^\dagger_k T + \\
c_k^\dagger T \eta_k - T^\dagger c_k \eta_k^\dagger
\eeq
By virtue of eq.~\ref{iden} and its conjugate, the first two terms will vanish.
\beq[link]
\ham\eta - \ham\eta_k^\dagger + \eta_k^\dagger \ham - \eta_k\ham = \eta_k^\dagger T^\dagger c_k - \eta_k c^\dagger_k T + c_k^\dagger T \eta_k - T^\dagger c_k \eta_k^\dagger
\eeq
From eq.~\ref{main},
\begin{gather}
\eta_k^\dagger T ^\dagger c_k = \eta_k^\dagger \eta_k c_k^\dagger T \eta_k = \hat n_k c_k^\dagger T\eta_k = c_k^\dagger T\eta_k\\
T ^\dagger c_k \eta_k^\dagger = \eta_k c_k^\dagger T \eta_k \eta_k^\dagger = \eta_k c_k^\dagger T \rr{1-\hat n_k} = \eta_k c_k^\dagger T\\
\end{gather}
Eq.~\ref{link} becomes
\beq
 \ham\eta - \ham\eta_k^\dagger + \eta_k^\dagger \ham - \eta_k\ham &= c_k^\dagger T\eta_k - \eta_k c^\dagger_k T + c_k^\dagger T \eta_k - \eta_k c_k^\dagger T
								     &=2\qq{c_k^\dagger T,\eta_k}
\eeq
Putting it all together,
\beq
 \wl \ham &= \hf\rr{\ham^D + \ham^i + \ham\eta - \ham\eta_k^\dagger + \eta_k^\dagger \ham + \eta_k^\dagger\ham\eta_k - \eta_k\ham  + \eta_k \ham \eta_k^\dagger}\\
	  &=\hf\rr{\ham^D + \ham^i} + \qq{c_k^\dagger T,\eta_k} + \hf\qq{H_e \hat n_k + H_h(1-\hat n_k)}
\eeq
One further simplification is possible.
The last two terms constitute the total diagonal part of the Hamiltonian, but so do the first two terms:
\beq
\ham^D + \ham^i = H_e \hat n_k + H_h\rr{1-\hat n_k}
\eeq
Hence,
\beq
 \wl \ham &= \hf\rr{\ham^D + \ham^i + \ham\eta - \ham\eta_k^\dagger + \eta_k^\dagger \ham + \eta_k^\dagger\ham\eta_k - \eta_k\ham  + \eta_k \ham \eta_k^\dagger}\\
	  &=H_e \hat n_k + H_h(1-\hat n_k) + \qq{c_k^\dagger T,\eta_k}\\
	  &=\text{Tr}\qq{\ham\hat n_k}\hat n_k + \text{Tr}\qq{\ham\hat(1- n_k)}(1-\hat n_k) + \qq{c_k^\dagger \text{Tr}\rr{\ham c_k},\eta_k}
\eeq
The two terms at the front can be written in a slightly different fashion.
\beq
 \text{Tr}\qq{\ham\hat n_k}\hat n_k + \text{Tr}\qq{\ham(1- \hat n_k)}(1-\hat n_k) &= \text{Tr}\qq{\ham\hat n_k}\hat n_k + \text{Tr}\qq{\ham(\hat n_k -1)}(\hat n_k -1)\\
										  &=\text{Tr}\qq{\ham\hat n_k}\hat n_k + \text{Tr}\qq{\ham(\hat n_k -1)}n_k -\text{Tr}\qq{\ham\hat(n_k -1)}\\
										  &=\text{Tr}\qq{\ham\rr{2\hat n_k - 1}}\hat n_k -\text{Tr}\qq{\ham(\hat n_k -1)}\\
										  &=\text{Tr}\qq{\ham\rr{\hat n_k - \hf}}2\hat n_k -\text{Tr}\qq{\ham(\hat n_k -\hf)} + \hf\text{Tr}\qq{\ham} \\
										  &= \text{Tr}\qq{\ham\rr{\hat n_k - \hf}}\rr{2\hat n_k - 1} + \hf\text{Tr}\qq{\ham}\\
										  &=\text{Tr}\qq{\ham\tau_k}2\tau_k + \hf\text{Tr}\qq{\ham}\\
\eeq
The last term can be written as:
\beq
 \qq{c_k^\dagger \text{Tr}\rr{\ham c_k},\eta_k} &= c_k^\dagger \text{Tr}\rr{\ham c_k}\eta_k - \eta_kc_k^\dagger \text{Tr}\rr{\ham c_k}\\
						&=\rr{2\hat n_k - 1}c_k^\dagger \text{Tr}\rr{\ham c_k}\eta_k - \rr{1-2\hat n_k}\eta_kc_k^\dagger \text{Tr}\rr{\ham c_k}
\eeq
I used \il{\hat n_k c^\dagger_k = c^\dagger_k} and \il{\hat n_k \eta_k = 0}.
Then,
\beq
 \qq{c_k^\dagger \text{Tr}\rr{\ham c_k},\eta_k} = 2\tau_k \cc{c_k^\dagger \text{Tr}\rr{\ham c_k},\eta_k}
\eeq
The final form of the rotated Hamiltonian is
\bbx
\beq
\wl \ham = U_k \ham U_k^\dagger = \hf\text{Tr}\qq{\ham}+  2\tau_k\text{Tr}\qq{\ham\tau_k} + 2\tau_k \cc{c_k^\dagger \text{Tr}\rr{\ham c_k},\eta_k}
\eeq
\ebx
To check that this indeed commutes with \il{\hat n_k},
\beq
 \qq{\wl \ham, \hat n_k} &= \qq{\qq{c_k^\dagger T,\eta_k},\hat n_k}\\
			 &=\qq{c_k^\dagger T \eta_k,\hat n_k} - \qq{\eta_k c_k^\dagger T,\hat n_k}\\
			 &=c^\dagger_k T \eta_k \hat n_k - \hat n_kc^\dagger_k T \eta_k &&\qq{\text{2\uu{nd} [ .
] is 0, }\because c_k^\dagger \hat n_k = \hat n_k \eta_k=0}\\
			 &=c_k^\dagger T \eta_k - c_k^\dagger T \eta_k\\
			 &=0
\eeq

\eeq
The effective Hamiltonian after one step of the RG on the Hamiltonian \il{\ham_j} is
\beq

\eeq
The second term is of order \il{\tau^2}, so we drop it because they will vanish in thermodynamic limit:
\beq
\ham_{j,1} = \hf\text{Tr}_1\qq{\ham_j} + \tau_1 \cc{c_1^\dagger \text{Tr}_1\rr{\ham_j c_1},\eta_1}\eeq
We will keep dropping terms of second order from now on.
Also, we will assume at each  The second run gives

\implies \tau_2 \cc{c_2^\dagger \text{Tr}_2\rr{\ham_{j,1} c_2},\eta_2} &= \hf\tau_2 \cc{c_2^\dagger \text{Tr}_2\qq{\rr{\text{Tr}_{1}\ham_j}c_2},\eta_2} 
\eeq
Therefore,
\beq
 \ham_{j,2} &=\fr{1}{2^2}\text{Tr}_{1,2}\qq{\ham_j} +  \hf\tau_1\text{Tr}_{2}\cc{c_1^\dagger \text{Tr}_1\rr{\ham_j c_1},\eta_1} + \hf\tau_2 \cc{c_2^\dagger \text{Tr}_2\qq{\rr{\text{Tr}_{1}\ham_j}c_2},\eta_2}
\eeq
As part of keeping only the first order quantum fluctuations, we consider only one electron on the shell at a time.
That is, in the second term, \il{\ham_j} will have only 1 electron on the j\uu{th} shell and that electron will have the index 1.
Similarly, in the third term, the only electron on the shell will have index 2.
That means that the Tr\dd{2} and Tr\dd{1} are redundant in second and third terms respectively.
These redundant traces will cancel the half factors in front, giving us
\beq
 \ham_{j,2} &=\fr{1}{2^2}\text{Tr}_{1,2}\qq{\ham_j} +  \tau_1\cc{c_1^\dagger \text{Tr}_1\rr{\ham_j c_1},\eta_1} + \tau_2 \cc{c_2^\dagger \text{Tr}_2\qq{\rr{\ham_j}c_2},\eta_2}\\
	    &= \fr{1}{2^2}\text{Tr}_{1,2}\qq{\ham_j} +  \sum_{l=1}^2 \tau_l\cc{c_l^\dagger \text{Tr}_l\rr{\ham_j c_l},\eta_l}
\eeq
Proceeding similarly, the effective Hamiltonian obtained after disentangling all (\il{N_j}) momentum+spin states on the shell \il{\Lambda_j} is
\beq[dec]
\ham_{j-1} = 2^{-N_j}\text{Tr}_{1,2,...N_j}\ham_j + \sum_{l=1}^{N_j}\tau_l\cc{c^\dagger_{l}\text{Tr}_l\qq{\ham_j c_l},\eta_l}
\eeq
Here, \il{l} and the indices \il{1,2,...N} refer to fermionic degrees of freedom on the shell \il{\Lambda_j}.
That is, they are a placeholder for \il{(\mathbf q, \beta)} where \il{|\mathbf q| = \Lambda_j} and \il{\beta \in \{\ua,\da\}}.
More explicitly, the index 1 designates (\il{\mathbf k_{1,\ua}}),  the index 2 means (\il{\mathbf k_{1,\da}}),  the index 3 means (\il{\mathbf k_{2,\ua}}) and so on.\\\\
Let \il{j = j_\text{max}}.
That is, this is the first decoupling.
Then, \il{\ham_j = \ham}.
The first term in eq.~\ref{dec} is
\beq
\fr{1}{2^{N_j}}\text{Tr}_{1,2,...N_j}\ham
\eeq
As discussed before, in order to consider just the leading order quantum fluctuations, we will make the following simplification: While evaluating  the first trace, say Tr\dd{1}, we will assume the only electron on the j\uu{th} shell has that index.
Therefore,
\beq
\hf \text{Tr}_{k_1\sigma}\ham &= \hf\text{Tr}_{k_1\sigma}\qq{\sum_{k<\Lambda_j\atop{\alpha}}\epsilon_{k}\hat n_{k\alpha} + \fr{J}{2}\sum_{k,k^\prime<\Lambda_j\atop{\alpha,\alpha^\prime}} \mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha\alpha^\prime} c^\dagger_{k\alpha}c_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime} + \epsilon_{k_1} \hat n_{k_1\sigma} + \fr{J}{2}S^z \sigma^z_{\sigma} \hat n_{k_1\sigma}}\\
				     &=\sum_{k<\Lambda_j\atop{\alpha}}\epsilon_{k}\hat n_{k\alpha} + \fr{J}{2}\sum_{k,k^\prime<\Lambda_j\atop{\alpha,\alpha^\prime}} \mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha\alpha^\prime} c^\dagger_{k\alpha}c_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime} + \fr{\epsilon_{k_1}}{2} + \fr{J}{2}S^z \fr{\sigma}{2}\\
				     &\equiv H_{j-1} + \fr{\epsilon_{k_1}}{2} + \fr{J}{2}S^z \fr{\sigma}{2}\\
\eeq
The \il{H_{j-1}} part will not change.
To take the next partial trace \il{k_1\ol \sigma}, we add an electron in this state to the previous Hamiltonian:
\beq
\hf \text{Tr}_{k_1\ol \sigma}\qq{\hf \text{Tr}_{k_1\sigma}\ham} &=\hf \text{Tr}_{k_1\ol \sigma}\qq{H_{j-1} + \fr{\epsilon_{k_1}}{2} + \fr{J}{2}S^z \fr{\sigma}{2} + \epsilon_{k_1} \hat n_{k_1\ol\sigma} + \fr{J}{2}S^z \sigma^z_{\ol\sigma} \hat n_{k_1\ol\sigma}}\\
									    &= H_{j-1} + \fr{\epsilon_{k_1}}{2} + \fr{J}{2}S^z \fr{\sigma}{2}  + \hf \text{Tr}_{k_1\ol \sigma}\qq{\epsilon_{k_1} \hat n_{k_1\ol\sigma} + \fr{J}{2}S^z \sigma^z_{\ol\sigma} \hat n_{k_1\ol\sigma}}\\
									    &= H_{j-1} + \fr{\epsilon_{k_1}}{2} + \fr{J}{2}S^z \fr{\sigma}{2}  + \fr{\epsilon_{k_1}}{2} + \fr{J}{2}S^z \fr{\ol\sigma}{2}\\
									    &= H_{j-1} + \epsilon_{k_1} 
\eeq
Tracing over all the states will then give
\beq[fir]
\fr{1}{2^{N_j}}\text{Tr}_{1,2,...N_j}\ham = H_{j-1} + \sum_{|k|=\Lambda_j}\epsilon_{k} 
\eeq
\comm{
	\il{n_l} refers to the number of fermions in the state \il{\ket{N}}.
If I take a single inner product first,
\beq
\sum_{n_N=0,1} \bra{n_N} \ham \ket{n_N} = \sum_{k\alpha}\epsilon_k \sum_{n_N=0,1} \bra{n_N} \hat n_{k\alpha} \ket{n_N} + \fr{J}{2}\sum_{k,k^\prime,\alpha,\alpha^\prime} \mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha\alpha^\prime} \sum_{n_N=0,1} \bra{n_N}c^\dagger_{k\alpha}c_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime}\ket{n_N}
\eeq
The first term is easy:
\beq
 \sum_{n_N} \bra{n_N} \hat n_{k\alpha} \ket{n_N} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } N = (\mathbf{k}\alpha) \equiv (\mathbf{q}\beta) \\ 2 \hat n_{k\alpha}& \text{if } N \neq (\mathbf{k}\alpha) \end{cases}
\eeq
The second term gives
\beq
 \sum_{n_N} \bra{n_N} c^\dagger_{k\alpha}c_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime} \ket{n_N} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } (\mathbf{k}\alpha) = N = (\mathbf{k^\prime}\alpha^\prime) \equiv (\mathbf{q}\beta) \\ 0 &\text{if either } (\mathbf{k},\alpha) = N \text{ or } (\mathbf{k^\prime},\alpha^\prime) = N \\ 2c^\dagger_{k\alpha}c_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime}  & \text{if } (\mathbf{k^\prime},\alpha^\prime)\neq N \neq (\mathbf{k},\alpha)\end{cases}
\eeq
Therefore,
\beq
\sum_{k\alpha}\epsilon_k \sum_{n_N=0,1} \bra{n_N} \hat n_{k\alpha} \ket{n_N} = \sum_{k\alpha \neq N}2 \epsilon_k \hat n_{k\alpha} + \epsilon_N
\eeq
and
\beq[ss]
\fr{J}{2}\sum_{k,k^\prime,\alpha,\alpha^\prime} \mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha\alpha^\prime} \sum_{n_N=0,1} \bra{n_N}c^\dagger_{k\alpha}c_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime}\ket{n_N} = \fr{J}{2}\sum_{k\alpha\neq N\atop{k^\prime\alpha^\prime \neq N}} \mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha\alpha^\prime} 2c^\dagger_{k\alpha}c_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime} + \fr{J}{2}\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\beta\beta}
\eeq
If I now trace over all the momenta \il{|q| = \Lambda} and spins \il{\beta = \ua,\da}, I will get 
\beq
 \sum_{k\alpha}\epsilon_k \sum_{n_N=0,1} \bra{n_N} \hat n_{k\alpha} \ket{n_N} &\ra \sum_{k\alpha\neq N}2 \epsilon_k \hat n_{k\alpha} + \epsilon_N\\
									      &\ra\sum_{k\alpha\neq N,N-1}2^2 \epsilon_k \hat n_{k\alpha} + 2\epsilon_{N} + 2\epsilon_{N-1}\\
									      &\ra\sum_{|k|<\Lambda_j,\alpha}2^N \epsilon_k \hat n_{k\alpha} + 2^{N-1}\sum_{l=1}^N\epsilon_{l}\\
									      &=2^N \sum_{|k|<\Lambda_j,\alpha}\epsilon_k \hat n_{k\alpha} + 2^{N}\sum_{|q|=\Lambda_j}\epsilon_{q}
\eeq
The spin-spin interaction term eq.~\ref{ss} will lose the terms with \il{\sigma_{\beta\beta}} because \il{\beta} will be summed over and \il{\sum_\beta \mathbf{S}\cdot\mathbf{\sigma}_{\beta\beta} = \sum_\beta S^z\sigma^z_{\beta\beta} = 0}.
Therefore, only the first term survives
\beq
\fr{J}{2}\sum_{k,k^\prime,\alpha,\alpha^\prime} \mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha\alpha^\prime} \sum_{n_N=0,1} \bra{n_N}c^\dagger_{k\alpha}c_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime}\ket{n_N} \ra   2^N \fr{J}{2}\sum_{|k|,|k^\prime|<\Lambda_j\atop{\alpha,\alpha^\prime}} \mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha\alpha^\prime}c^\dagger_{k\alpha}c_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime}
\eeq
The first term of \il{\ham_{j-1}} is thus
\beq[fir]
 2^{-N}\text{Tr}_{1,2,...N}\ham_j &= \sum_{|k|<\Lambda_j,\alpha}\epsilon_k \hat n_{k\alpha} + \sum_{|q|=\Lambda_j}\epsilon_{q} + \fr{J}{2}\sum_{|k|,|k^\prime|<\Lambda_j\atop{\alpha,\alpha^\prime}} \mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha\alpha^\prime}c^\dagger_{k\alpha}c_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime}\\
				  &={\sum_{k,k^\prime\atop{\alpha,\alpha^\prime}}}^<\rr{\epsilon_k \hat n_{k\alpha} + \fr{J}{2}\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha\alpha^\prime}c^\dagger_{k\alpha}c_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime}} + \hf{\sum_{q,\alpha}}^=\epsilon_q
\eeq
\il{\sum^<} means the sum is over all states below the shell \il{\Lambda_j} while \il{\sum^=} means the sum is over all states pn the shell \il{\Lambda_j}.}
Now I need to compute the second term.
That term involves another trace, \il{\text{Tr}_l\qq{\ham c_l}}.
The kinetic energy term will not survive this.
The only terms that will survive are those that have exactly one \il{c_{q\beta}^\dagger}.

\beq
 \avg{n_{q\beta}|c^\dagger_{k\alpha} c_{k\alpha} c_{q\beta}|n_{q\beta}} = \begin{cases} c^\dagger_{k\alpha} c_{k\alpha} \avg{n_{q\beta}|c_{q\beta}|n_{q\beta}} = 0 & \text{if }{k\alpha}\neq {q\beta} \\ \avg{n_{q\beta}|c^\dagger_{q\beta} c_{q\beta}^2|n_{q\beta}} =0&\text{if } {k\alpha}={q\beta} \end{cases}
\eeq
\beq
 \avg{n_{q\beta}|c^\dagger_{k\alpha} c_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime} c_{q\beta}|n_{q\beta}} = \begin{cases} c^\dagger_{k\alpha} c_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime} \avg{n_{q\beta}|c_{q\beta}|n_{q\beta}} = 0 & \text{if }{k\alpha}\neq {q\beta}\neq {k^\prime\alpha^\prime}\\ \avg{n_{q\beta}|c^\dagger_{q\beta} c_{q\beta}^2|n_{q\beta}} =0&\text{if } {k\alpha}={q\beta}= {k^\prime\alpha^\prime} \\ \avg{n_{q\beta}|c^\dagger_{q\beta} c_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime}c_{q\beta}|n_{q\beta}} = c_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime}&\text{if } {k\alpha}={q\beta} \neq {k^\prime\alpha^\prime}\end{cases}
\eeq
Therefore, the trace becomes
\beq
\text{Tr}\qq{\ham c_{q\beta}} = \fr{J}{2}\sum_{k\alpha \neq q\beta} \mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\beta\alpha}c_{k\alpha}
\eeq
In line with our intention of keeping just the leading order quantum fluctuations and placing just one electron on the current shell, we will assume the \il{k\alpha} degree of freedom lies on lower shells (\il{k < \Lambda^*}).

\beq
\text{Tr}\qq{\ham c_{q\beta}} = \fr{J}{2}\sum_{k<\Lambda^*,\alpha} \mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\beta\alpha}c_{k\alpha}
\eeq
Its conjugate is
\beq
\text{Tr}\qq{c_{q\beta}^\dagger\ham } = \fr{J}{2}\sum_{k<\Lambda^*,\alpha} \mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha\beta}c^\dagger_{k\alpha}
\eeq
We also compute another trace: \il{\text{Tr}_{q\beta}\rr{\ham^D \hat n_{q\beta}}}, where
\beq
 \ham^D \hat n_{q\beta}&=\ham_{j-1}^D \hat n_{q\beta}+ \epsilon_{q} \hat n_{q\beta}^2 + \fr{J}{2}S^z\sigma^z_{\beta\beta}\hat n_{q\beta}^2\\
		       &= \qq{\ham_{j-1}^D + \epsilon_{q}  + \fr{J}{2}S^z\sigma^z_{\beta\beta}}\hat n_{q\beta}\\
\eeq
Therefore,
\beq
 \text{Tr}_{q\beta}\rr{\ham^D n_{q\beta}} &= \ham_{j-1}^D + \epsilon_{q}  + \fr{J}{2}S^z\sigma^z_{\beta\beta}
\eeq
This allows us to write the \il{\eta_{q\beta}}:
\beq
 \eta_{q\beta} = \qq{\eta^\dagger_{q\beta}}^\dagger &= \qq{\fr{1}{\hat\omega - \text{Tr}\rr{\ham^D \hat n_{q\beta}}\hat n_{q\beta}}c^\dagger_{q\beta}T}^\dagger\\
						    &= \text{Tr}\qq{c^\dagger_{q\beta}\ham}c_{q\beta}\fr{1}{\hat\omega - \text{Tr}\rr{\ham^D \hat n_{q\beta}}\hat n_{q\beta}}\\
						    &=  \fr{J}{2}\sum_{k<\Lambda^*,\alpha} \mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha\beta}c^\dagger_{k\alpha} c_{q\beta}\fr{1}{\hat\omega - \rr{\ham_{j-1}^D + \epsilon_{q}  + \fr{J}{2}S^z\sigma^z_{\beta\beta}}\hat n_{q\beta}}\\
\eeq
Since \il{\hat\omega} is diagonal in \il{\hat n_{q\beta}} by definition, we can absorb the diagonal piece \il{\ham_{j-1}^D\hat n_{q\beta}} and a constant \il{\epsilon_q} and redefine \il{\hat \omega}.
\beq
 \eta_{q\beta} &= \fr{J}{2}\sum_{k<\Lambda^*,\alpha} \mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha\beta}c^\dagger_{k\alpha} c_{q\beta}\fr{1}{\hat \omega - \epsilon_{q} \tau_{q\beta} - \fr{J}{2}S^z\sigma^z_{\beta\beta}\hat n_{q\beta}}\\
	       &= \fr{J}{2}\sum_{k<\Lambda^*,\alpha} \mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha\beta}c^\dagger_{k\alpha} c_{q\beta}\fr{1}{\hat \omega - \epsilon_{q} \tau_{q\beta} - \fr{J}{2}S^z\sigma^z_{\beta\beta}\hat n_{q\beta}}\\
\eeq
Define \il{\mc{X}_{q\beta} = \sum_{k<\Lambda^*,\alpha} \mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha\beta}c^\dagger_{k\alpha} c_{q\beta}}.
The second term in the effective Hamiltonian \il{\ham_{j-1}} can then be written as
\beq
 \sum_{q\beta}\tau_{q\beta}\cc{c^\dagger_{q\beta}\text{Tr}_{q\beta}\qq{\ham_j  c_{q\beta}},\eta_{q\beta}} &= \sum_{|q|=\Lambda_j,\atop{\beta=\ua,\da}} \tau_{q\beta}\cc{\fr{J}{2}\mc{X}^\dagger_{q\beta},\fr{J}{2}\mc{X}_{q\beta}\fr{1}{\hat \omega - \epsilon_{q} \tau_{q\beta} - \fr{J}{2}S^z\sigma^z_{\beta\beta}\hat n_{q\beta}}}
\eeq
Substituting \il{\hat \omega = 2\omega \tau_{q\beta}},
\beq
 \sum_{q\beta}\tau_{q\beta}\cc{c^\dagger_{q\beta}\text{Tr}_{q\beta}\qq{\ham_j  c_{q\beta}},\eta_{q\beta}} &= \rr{\fr{J}{2}}^2\sum_{|q|=\Lambda_j,\atop{\beta=\ua,\da}} \tau_{q\beta}\cc{\mc{X}^\dagger_{q\beta},\mc{X}_{q\beta}\fr{1}{2\omega \tau_{q\beta} - \epsilon_{q} \tau_{q\beta} - \fr{J}{2}S^z\sigma^z_{\beta\beta}\hat n_{q\beta}}}
\eeq
\textcolor{red}{Assuming the factor with \il{\omega} commutes, we can write this as } 
\beq
 \sum_{q\beta}\tau_{q\beta}\cc{c^\dagger_{q\beta}\text{Tr}_{q\beta}\qq{\ham_j  c_{q\beta}},\eta_{q\beta}} &= \rr{\fr{J}{2}}^2\sum_{|q|=\Lambda_j,\atop{\beta=\ua,\da}} \tau_{q\beta}\fr{1}{2\omega \tau_{q\beta} - \epsilon_{q} \tau_{q\beta} - \fr{J}{2}S^z\sigma^z_{\beta\beta}\hat n_{q\beta}}\cc{\mc{X}^\dagger_{q\beta},\mc{X}_{q\beta}}
\eeq
The anticommutator can now be evaluated:
\beq
\cc{\mc{X}^\dagger_{q\beta},\mc{X}_{q\beta}} &= \sum_{k,k^\prime<\Lambda^*,\alpha\gamma} \cc{\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\beta\gamma}c^\dagger_{q\beta} c_{k^\prime\gamma},\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha\beta}c^\dagger_{k\alpha} c_{q\beta}}\\
					     &= \sum_{a,b}\sum_{k,k^\prime<\Lambda^*\atop{\alpha\gamma}} \cc{{S^a}{\sigma^a}_{\beta\gamma}c^\dagger_{q\beta} c_{k^\prime\gamma},{S^b}{\sigma^b}_{\alpha\beta}c^\dagger_{k\alpha} c_{q\beta}}\\
					     &= \sum_{a,b}\sum_{k,k^\prime<\Lambda^*\atop{\alpha\gamma}} \qq{{S^a}{S^b}{\sigma^a}_{\beta\gamma}{\sigma^b}_{\alpha\beta}\hat n_{q\beta} c_{k^\prime\gamma} c^\dagger_{k\alpha}+ {S^b}{S^a}{\sigma^b}_{\alpha\beta}{\sigma^a}_{\beta\gamma} \rr{1 - \hat n_{q\beta}} c^\dagger_{k\alpha}c_{k^\prime\gamma} }\\
\eeq
\comm{
Since we will replace \il{\hat \omega} with some function of \il{\tau_l}, the fraction with \il{\omega} will commute with all the operators.
Therefore,

\beq[kura]
\sum_{l=1}^{N}\tau_l\left\{c^\dagger_{l}\text{Tr}_l\qq{\ham_j  c_l},\eta_l\right\} &= \sum_{|q|=\Lambda_j,\atop{\beta=\ua,\da}} \fr{J^2\tau_{q\beta}}{4\rr{\hat{\ol\omega}-\xi_{q\beta}\tau_{q\beta}}}\sum_{k\alpha \neq q\beta\atop{k^\prime\alpha ^\prime\neq q\beta}} \left\{\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\beta\alpha}c^\dagger_{q\beta} c_{k\alpha},\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha^\prime\beta}c^\dagger_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime} c_{q\beta}\right\}\\
										   &=\fr{J}{2}\sum_{l=1}^N \fr{J\tau_{q\beta}}{2\rr{\hat{\ol\omega}-\xi_{q\beta}\tau_{q\beta}}}\sum_{m\neq l\neq m^\prime}\mc{C}_{m,m^\prime,l}
\eeq
where \il{m\equiv k\alpha, m^\prime \equiv k^\prime\alpha^\prime} and \il{\mc{C}_{lmm^\prime}} is the anticommutator \il{\left\{\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\beta\alpha}c^\dagger_{q\beta} c_{k\alpha},\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha^\prime\beta}c^\dagger_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime} c_{q\beta}\right\}}.
Denote the prefactor in eq.~\ref{kura} as \il{\Gamma_{q\beta}}.
The sum \il{\sum_{m\neq l\neq m^\prime}} is over all points \il{m,m^\prime} except the point \il{m=m^\prime=l}.
Split the sum in the following way: 
\beq
\sum_{m\neq l\neq m^\prime} = \sum_{|k|,|k^\prime|<\Lambda_j\atop{\alpha,\alpha^\prime}} + \sum_{k=k^\prime=q\atop{\alpha=\alpha^\prime\neq\beta}} + \text{ other terms}
\eeq
The second term gives
\beq
\sum_{k=k^\prime=q\atop{\alpha=\alpha^\prime\neq\beta}}\left\{\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\beta\alpha}c^\dagger_{q\beta} c_{q\alpha},\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha^\prime\beta}c^\dagger_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime} c_{q\beta}\right\} &= \sum_{\alpha\neq\beta} \left\{\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\beta\alpha}c^\dagger_{q\beta} c_{q\alpha},\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha\beta}c^\dagger_{q\alpha} c_{q\beta}\right\}\\
																														   &=\sum_{\alpha\neq\beta}\rr{\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\beta\alpha}}\rr{\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha\beta}}\hat n_{q\beta}\rr{1-\hat n_{q\alpha}} + \alpha\leftrightarrow\beta
\eeq
Keeping in mind that \il{\alpha \neq \beta} and hence only those \il{\sigma_{\beta\alpha}} that have off-diagonal terms can survive, the scalar products evaluate to
\beq
\rr{\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\beta\alpha}}\rr{\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha\beta}} &= \rr{S^x\sigma^x_{\beta\alpha} + S^y\sigma^y_{\beta\alpha}}\rr{S^x\sigma^x_{\alpha\beta} + S^y\sigma^y_{\alpha\beta}}\\
\eeq
Now, we use the following identities:
\begin{gather}
\rr{S^a}^2 = \fr{1}{4}\\
S^x S^y = -S^yS^x = \fr{i}{2}S^z\\
\sigma^x_{\alpha\beta} = \sigma^x_{\beta\alpha}\\
\sigma^y_{\alpha\beta} = -\sigma^y_{\beta\alpha}
\end{gather}
For the special case \il{\alpha \neq \beta}, we have
\begin{gather}
\sigma^x_{\alpha\beta} = \sigma^x_{\beta\alpha} = 1\\
\sigma^y_{\alpha\beta} = -\sigma^y_{\beta\alpha} = -i\sigma_{\alpha\alpha}^z=i\sigma_{\beta\beta}
\end{gather}
Using these identities, the scalar product becomes
\beq
\rr{\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\beta\alpha}}\rr{\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha\beta}} &=\rr{S^x - S^y\sigma^y_{\alpha\beta}}\rr{S^x + S^y\sigma^y_{\alpha\beta}}\\
												     &=\fr{1}{4} + \qq{S^x,S^y}\sigma^y_{\alpha\beta} - \fr{1}{4}\rr{\sigma^y_{\alpha\beta}}^2\\
												     &=\hf + iS^z\sigma^y_{\alpha\beta}\\
												     &= \hf - S^z\sigma^z_{\beta\beta}
\eeq
The second term then gives
\beq
\sum_{k=k^\prime=q\atop{\alpha=\alpha^\prime\neq\beta}}\cc{\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\beta\alpha}c^\dagger_{q\beta} c_{q\alpha},\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha^\prime\beta}c^\dagger_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime{q\beta}}} &= \sum_{\alpha\neq\beta}\hat n_{q\beta}\rr{1-\hat n_{q\alpha}}\rr{\hf - S^z\sigma^z_{\beta\beta}} + \alpha\leftrightarrow\beta\\
																												      &=\qq{\fr{\rr{n_{q\beta} - n_{q\ol\beta}}^2}{2} - S^z\sigma^z_{\beta\beta}2\fr{n_{q\beta} - n_{q\ol\beta}}{2}}
\eeq
The term with \il{S^z} can be simplified:
\beq
\sigma^z_{\beta\beta}\fr{n_{q\beta} - n_{q\ol\beta}}{2} = \begin{cases}\fr{n_{q\ua} - n_{q\da}}{2} &\text{ when }\beta=\ua\\ -\fr{n_{q\da} - n_{q\ua}}{2} &\text{ when }\beta=\da\end{cases}\Bigg\} = \fr{n_{q\ua} - n_{q\da}}{2} \equiv s^z_q
\eeq
The second term thus becomes
\beq
\sum_{k=k^\prime=q\atop{\alpha=\alpha^\prime\neq\beta}}\cc{\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\beta\alpha}c^\dagger_{q\beta} c_{q\alpha},\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha^\prime\beta}c^\dagger_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime{q\beta}}} &= \qq{\fr{\rr{n_{q\beta} - n_{q\ol\beta}}^2}{2} - 2S^zs^z_q}
\eeq
We drop the first term because it does not have  \il{S^z} and hence does not renormalize the Ising term.
Joining with the \il{\Gamma_{q\beta}} prefactor, we get
\beq
\fr{J}{2}\sum_{l=1}^N\Gamma_{q\beta} \sum_{k=k^\prime=q\atop{\alpha=\alpha^\prime\neq\beta}}\mc{C}_{m,m^\prime,l}&= \fr{J}{2}\sum_{l=1}^N \fr{J\tau_{q\beta}}{2\rr{\hat{\ol\omega}-\xi_{q\beta}\tau_{q\beta}}}\rr{- 2S^zs^z_q}
\eeq
We replace \il{\hat{\ol \omega}} with \il{2\omega \tau_{q\beta}}.
This gives
\beq
\fr{J}{2}\sum_{l=1}^N\Gamma_{q\beta} \sum_{k=k^\prime=q\atop{\alpha=\alpha^\prime\neq\beta}}\mc{C}_{m,m^\prime,l}&=-\fr{J^2}{2}\sum_{|q|=\Lambda_j}S^zs^z_q\sum_{\beta}\fr{\tau_{q\beta}}{\rr{2\omega\tau_{q\beta} - \xi_{q\beta}\tau_{q\beta}}}
\eeq
By setting \il{\tau_{q\beta} = \fr{\beta}{2}}, we can perform the sum over \il{\beta}:
\beq
\sum_{\beta}\fr{\tau_{q\beta}}{\rr{2\omega\tau_{q\beta} - \xi_{q\beta}\tau_{q\beta}}} = \hf\qq{\fr{1}{\omega - \fr{\epsilon_q}{2} - \hf\fr{J}{2}S^z \sigma^z_{\ua\ua}} - \fr{1}{-\omega + \fr{\epsilon_q}{2} + \hf\fr{J}{2}S^z \sigma^z_{\da\da}}} = \fr{\omega - \fr{\epsilon_q}{2}}{\rr{\omega - \fr{\epsilon_q}{2}}^2 - \fr{J^2}{64}}
\eeq
In total, we get
\beq[aluka]
-\fr{J^2}{2}\fr{\omega - \fr{\epsilon_j}{2}}{\rr{\omega - \fr{\epsilon_j}{2}}^2 - \fr{J^2}{64}}\sum_{|q|=\Lambda_j}S^zs^z_q
\eeq
The first term gives
\beq
\sum_{|k|,|k^\prime|<\Lambda_j\atop{\alpha,\alpha^\prime}}\mc{C}_{m,m^\prime,l} &= \sum_{|k|,|k^\prime|<\Lambda_j\atop{\alpha,\alpha^\prime}} \left\{\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\beta\alpha^\prime}c^\dagger_{q\beta} c_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime},\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha\beta}c^\dagger_{k\alpha} c_{q\beta}\right\}\\
									       &=\rr{1-\hat n_{q\beta}}\sum_{|k|,|k^\prime|<\Lambda_j\atop{\alpha,\alpha^\prime}}c^\dagger_{k\alpha} c_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime}\rr{\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha\beta}}\rr{\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\beta\alpha^\prime}} \\
									       &\quad\quad+ \hat n_{q\beta}\sum_{|k|,|k^\prime|<\Lambda_j\atop{\alpha,\alpha^\prime}}c_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime}c^\dagger_{k\alpha}\rr{\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\beta\alpha^\prime}}\rr{\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha\beta}}
\eeq
Taking the term with \il{1-\hat n_{q\beta}} as the renormalizing term, the renormalization becomes
\beq[mirai]
\fr{J}{2}\sum_{l=1}^N\Gamma_{q\beta} \sum_{|k|,|k^\prime|<\Lambda_j\atop{\alpha,\alpha^\prime}}\mc{C}_{m,m^\prime,l}&=\fr{J^2}{4}\sum_{|k|,|k^\prime|<\Lambda_j\atop{\alpha,\alpha^\prime}}\sum_{|q|=\Lambda_j,\beta}\fr{\tau_{q\beta}}{\rr{2\omega\tau_{q\beta}-\xi_{q\beta}\tau_{q\beta}}}c^\dagger_{k\alpha} c_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime}\rr{\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha\beta}}\rr{\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\beta\alpha^\prime}} \\
&=\fr{J^2}{4}\sum_{|k|,|k^\prime|<\Lambda_j\atop{\alpha,\alpha^\prime}}c^\dagger_{k\alpha} c_{k^\prime\alpha^\prime}\sum_{|q|=\Lambda_j,\beta}\fr{\tau_{q\beta}}{\rr{2\omega\tau_{q\beta}-\xi_{q\beta}\tau_{q\beta}}}\rr{\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\alpha\beta}}\rr{\mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{\sigma}_{\beta\alpha^\prime}} \\
\eeq
Combining eqs.~\ref{fir},~\ref{aluka} and ~\ref{mirai}, the renormalized Hamiltonian is
}
\textcolor{red}{After lots of calculation,}
\beq[rgeqt]

\eeq


\subsection{Fixed-point Hamiltonian}
The RG starts from \il{j=N} and runs down to \il{j^*<N}.
As a result, integrating out the \il{j^\text{th}} Hamiltonian gives the \il{(j-1)^\text{th}} Hamiltonian.
\il{\Lambda_N} is the highest momentum being integrated out and is thus the Brillouin zone edge.
From eq.~\ref{rgeqt}, we can write
\beq[diffeq]
J^{j-1} &= J^j + \fr{n_j J_j^2 \rr{\omega - \fr{\hbar v_F}{2}\Lambda^j}}{\rr{\omega - \fr{\hbar v_F}{2}\Lambda^j}^2 - \fr{1}{16}{J^j}^2}\\
\implies \Delta J^j &\equiv J^{j-1} - J^j = \fr{n_j J_j^2 \rr{\omega - \fr{\hbar v_F}{2}\Lambda^j}}{\rr{\omega - \fr{\hbar v_F}{2}\Lambda^j}^2 - \fr{1}{16}{J^j}^2}\\
\eeq
Parameterizing the momenta as \il{\Lambda_j = \Lambda_N e^{j-N}}, we can write 
\beq
-\Delta \log \Lambda_j \equiv -\rr{\log \Lambda_{j-1} - \log \Lambda_{j}} = \log \fr{\Lambda_j}{\Lambda_{j-1}}=\log \fr{e^{j-N}}{e^{j-N-1}} = 1
\eeq
We can then write the difference equation, eq.~\ref{diffeq}, as
\beq
-\fr{\Delta J_j}{\Delta\log \Lambda_j} = \fr{n_j J_j^2 \rr{\omega - \fr{\hbar v_F}{2}\Lambda_j}}{\rr{\omega - \fr{\hbar v_F}{2}\Lambda_j}^2 - \fr{1}{16}{J_j}^2}
\eeq
Changing this to a continuum equation gives
\beq[rgeq]
\dv{J}{\tilde \Lambda}  = -\fr{n}{\Lambda} \fr{\rr{\omega - \tilde \Lambda}}{\rr{\fr{\omega - \tilde \Lambda}{J}}^2 - \fr{1}{16}}
\eeq
where \il{\tilde \Lambda = \fr{\hbar v_F}{2}\Lambda}.
Define a dimensionless coupling 
\beq
K = \fr{J}{\omega - \tilde \Lambda}
\eeq
Therefore,
\beq
\dv{J}{\tilde \Lambda} = \dv{\qq{K\rr{\omega - \tilde \Lambda}}}{\tilde \Lambda} = \rr{\omega - \tilde \Lambda}\dv{K}{\tilde \Lambda} - K
\eeq
Rewriting the RG equation ~\ref{rgeq} in terms of \il{K} gives
\beq
\rr{\omega - \tilde \Lambda}\dv{K}{\tilde \Lambda} - K &=- \fr{nK^2}{\Lambda} \fr{\rr{\omega - \tilde \Lambda}}{1 - \fr{K^2}{16}}\\
\implies \tilde \Lambda \dv{K}{\tilde \Lambda} &= \fr{K}{\fr{\omega}{\Lambda} - 1} + \fr{n K^2}{\fr{K^2}{16} - 1}
\eeq
Close to the Fermi surface (\il{\tilde \Lambda \to 0}),
\beq[fseqtn]
\dv{K}{\log \tilde \Lambda} = \fr{n(0) K^2}{\fr{K^2}{16} - 1} \equiv \beta(K)
\eeq
where \il{n(0)} is the DOS on FS.
There are two fixed points, \il{K^*=0} and \il{K^*=4}.
At both these points, \il{\beta(K)} changes sign.
At \il{K=0}, it changes between \il{0^+} and \il{0^-}, while at \il{K=4}, it switches between \il{\pm \infty}.
\pb
Integrating eq.~\ref{fseqtn} from \il{\Lambda_N} to \il{\Lambda^*} gives
\beq
\int_{K_N}^{K^*} dK\fr{1- \fr{K^2}{16} }{K^2} &=  -n(0)\int_{\Lambda_N}^{\Lambda^*} d\log \tilde\Lambda\\
\implies -n(0)\log \fr{\Lambda^*}{\Lambda_N} &= \int_{K_N}^{K^*} dK\rr{\fr{1}{K^2} - \fr{1}{16}} = \fr{1}{K_N} - \fr{1}{K^*} - \fr{K^* - K_N}{16} \\
\implies \Lambda^* &=  \Lambda_N \exp\qq{-\fr{1}{n(0)}\rr{\fr{1}{K_N} + \fr{K_N}{16} - \hf}}\\
\implies T_K &=  \fr{E(\Lambda^*)}{k_B} =\fr{\hbar v_F \Lambda^*}{k_B} = \fr{\hbar v_F \Lambda_N}{k_B} \exp\qq{-\fr{1}{n(0)}\rr{\fr{1}{K_N} + \fr{K_N}{16} - \hf}}\\
\implies \xi_K &= \fr{2\pi}{\Lambda^*} = \fr{2\pi}{\Lambda_N} \exp\qq{\fr{1}{n(0)}\rr{\fr{1}{K_N} + \fr{K_N}{16} - \hf}}\\
\eeq
At the fixed point, the effective Hamiltonian is of the form
\beq[fixham]
\ham &= \sum_{k<\Lambda^*,\sigma} \epsilon_k \hat n_{k\sigma} + \fr{J^*}{2}\sum_{k_1,k_2 < \Lambda^*\atop{\alpha,\beta}} \mb{S}\cdot \mb{\sigma}_{\alpha\beta} c^\dagger_{k_1,\alpha} c_{k_2,\beta} + \sum_{k>\Lambda^*} J_k S^z s^z_k\\
	       &\equiv \ham_0^* + \fr{J^*}{2}\sum_{k_1,k_2 < \Lambda^*\atop{\alpha,\beta}} \mb{S}\cdot \mb{\sigma}_{\alpha\beta} c^\dagger_{k_1,\alpha} c_{k_2,\beta} + \sum_{k>\Lambda^*} J_k S^z s^z_k
\eeq
\il{\ham^*_0} is the kinetic energy of the Kondo cloud (electrons lying inside \il{\Lambda^*}).
The zero-mode Hamiltonian is
\beq
\ham_\text{coll} &= \fr{J^*}{2}\sum_{k_1,k_2 < \Lambda^*\atop{\alpha,\beta}} \mb{S}\cdot \mb{\sigma}_{\alpha\beta} c^\dagger_{k_1,\alpha} c_{k_2,\beta} + \sum_{k>\Lambda^*} J_k S^z s^z_k\\
		 &= J^* \mb{S}\cdot \mb{s} + S^z \sum_{k>\Lambda^*} J_k s^z_k
\eeq
where
\beq
\mb{s} = \sum_{k_1,k_2 < \Lambda^*}\mb{s}_{k_1,k_2} \equiv \sum_{k_1,k_2 < \Lambda^*\atop{\alpha,\beta}} \fr{\vec{\sigma}_{\alpha\beta}}{2} c^\dagger_{k_1,\alpha} c_{k_2,\beta}
\eeq
and (consequently),
\begin{gather}
	s^z_{k,q} = \sum_{\alpha,\beta} \fr{\sigma^z_{\alpha\beta}}{2} c^\dagger_{k,\alpha} c_{q,\beta} = \hf\rr{c^\dagger_{k\ua}c_{q\ua} + c^\dagger_{k\da}c_{q\da}}\\
s^x_{k,q} = \hf\rr{c^\dagger_{k\ua}c_{q\da} + c^\dagger_{k\da}c_{q\ua}}\\
s^y_{k,q} = \fr{-i}{2}\rr{c^\dagger_{k\ua}c_{q\da} - c^\dagger_{k\da}c_{q\ua}}\\
s^+_{k,q} = c^\dagger_{k\ua}c_{q\da}\\
s^-_{k,q} = c^\dagger_{k\da}c_{q\ua}\label{sminus}\\
s^z_k \equiv s^z_{k,k} = \sum_{\alpha,\beta} \fr{\sigma^z_{\alpha\beta}}{2} c^\dagger_{k,\alpha} c_{k,\beta} = \hf\rr{\hat n_{k\ua} - \hat n_{k\da}}
\end{gather}
The ground state is
\beq
\ket{\Psi^*} = \fr{1}{\sqrt 2}\sum_{|\mb{k}|<\Lambda^*}\rr{\ket{\ua_d}\ket{\da_\mb{k}}  \ket{\da_{\mb{q}}}- \ket{\da_d}\ket{\ua_\mb{k}} \ket{\ua_{\mb{q}}}}
\eeq
The ground state energy is obtained by acting the Hamiltonian on this state:
\beq
\ham_\text{coll} \ket{\Psi^*} &= -\fr{3J^*}{2}\ket{\Psi^*} - \fr{J^q}{4}\ket{\Psi^*}\\
			      &= -\fr{1}{4}\rr{6J^* + J^q}\ket{\Psi^*}
\eeq
The \il{-\fr{3J^*}{2}} comes from the action of 
\beq
\mb{S}\cdot\mb{s} = S_\text{tot}\rr{S_\text{tot} + 1} - S^2 - s^2 = S_\text{tot}\rr{S_\text{tot} + 1} - \fr{3}{2}
\eeq
on the singlet state (\il{S_\text{tot} = 0}), \il{\mb{S}_\text{tot}} being \il{\mb{S} + \mb{s}}.
The lowest value of the energy occurs when \il{\mb{q}} is placed on the shell \il{\Lambda^*}, because \il{J^q} falls rapidly with distance from the Kondo cloud.
Therefore,
\beq
E_g = -\fr{7J^*}{4}
\eeq
\subsection{Some entanglement measures}
We can represent the ground state wavefunction in a compact manner:
\beq
\ket{\Psi^*} = \ket{\ua_d}\ket{\da_\mb{k}}  \ket{\da_{\mb{q}}}- \ket{\da_d}\ket{\ua_\mb{k}} \ket{\ua_{\mb{q}}}
\eeq
\il{\ket{\ua_k}} represents \il{\sum_{k<\Lambda^*}\ket{\ua_k}}.
We can label the states of the combined Hilbert space of Kondo cloud and impurity as \il{1,2,3} and 4, which represent \il{\ket{\ua\ua},\ket{\ua\da},\ket{\da\ua},\ket{\da\da}} respectively.
The ground state, in this notation, is \il{\ket{\Psi^*} = \fr{1}{\sqrt 2}\rr{\ket{2}\ket{\da} - \ket{3}\ket{\ua}}}.
First we compute the density matrix for this state:
\beq
\rho_\text{all} &= \ket{\Psi^*}\bra{\Psi^*}\\
		&= \hf\qq{\ket{2}\bra{2}\otimes\ket{\da}\bra{\da} - \ket{2}\bra{3}\otimes\ket{\da}\bra{\ua} - \ket{3}\bra{2}\otimes\ket{\ua}\bra{\da} + \ket{3}\bra{3}\otimes\ket{\ua}\bra{\ua}}
\eeq
The reduced density matrix for the local Fermi liquid (LFL) is obtained by partial tracing over the cloud+impurity, that is, over the states \il{\ket{1}} through \il{\ket{4}}.

\beq
\rho_\text{LFL} &= \text{Tr}_\text{imp+cloud}\qq{\rho_\text{all}}\\
		&=\sum_i\bra{i} \rho_\text{all}\ket{i}\\
		&= \hf\rr{\ket{\ua}\bra{\ua} + \ket{\da}\bra{\da}}
\eeq
This is just \hf times identity matrix in two dimensions, so the eigenvalues are both \hf.
The von-Neumann entropy for a matrix \il{\rho} is defined as \il{S =- \sum_\lambda \lambda \ln \lambda}, where the sum is over the eigenvalues of the matrix.

\beq
S_\text{LFL} = -2\times\hf\ln \hf = \ln 2
\eeq
Since von-Neumann entropy is independent of which partial system I trace over, it will be same if I had instead traced over the imp+cloud system.
Still I will calculate the reduced density matrix because I will need it to trace over the cloud or the impurity.
\beq
\rho_\text{imp+cloud} &= \text{Tr}_\text{LFL}\qq{\rho_\text{all}}\\
		      &= \sum_{m=\pm \ua,\da} \bra{m}\rho_\text{all}\ket{m}\\
		      &= \hf\rr{\ket{2}\bra{2} +\ket{3}\bra{3}}\\
		      &= \hf\begin{pmatrix} 0 &&& \\ &1&&\\&&1&\\&&&0 \end{pmatrix}
\eeq
As mentioned just before, the non-zero eigenvalues are again both \il{\hf} so the von-Neumann entropy is the same as \il{S_\text{LFL}}:
\beq
S_\text{imp+cloud} = -2\times\hf\ln \hf = \ln 2
\eeq
To find the von-Neumann entropy for just the impurity, we can partial trace over the cloud:
\beq
\rho_\text{imp} &= \text{Tr}_\text{cloud}\qq{\rho_\text{imp+cloud}}\\
		&= \text{Tr}_\text{cloud}\qq{\hf\rr{\ket{\ua}\bra{\ua}\otimes\ket{\da}\bra{\da} + \ket{\da}\bra{\da}\otimes\ket{\ua}\bra{\ua}}}\\
		&= \hf\rr{\ket{\ua}\bra{\ua} +\ket{\da}\bra{\da}}\\
		&= \hf\begin{pmatrix} 1 &\\&1\end{pmatrix}\\
S_\text{imp} &= \ln 2
\eeq
which also means
\beq
S_\text{cloud} &= \ln 2
\eeq
We thus have the conclusion that all partial systems (imp, cloud,LFL, imp+cloud, cloud+LFL, imp+LFL) have an entropy of \il{\ln 2} and are thus maximally entangled with their partners.
We can also compute the mutual information between the LFL and imp+cloud systems.
It is defined as \il{I(A,B) = S_A + S_B - S_{AB}}.
\beq
I(\text{imp+cloud, LFL}) = S_\text{imp+cloud} + S_\text{LFL} - S_\text{all} = 2\ln 2
\eeq
where I used the fact that \il{S_\text{all}} is 0 because \il{\ket{\Psi^*}} is a pure state.

\subsection{Local Fermi liquid Hamiltonian}
The effective Hamiltonian of the disentangled electrons is found by tracing out the impurity and cloud parts from the total density matrix of the low energy Hamiltonian \il{\ham_\text{coll}}:
\beq
\rho &= \exp\qq{-\beta\ham_\text{coll}}\\
     &= \exp\qq{-\beta\rr{\ham_0 + J^* \mb{S}\cdot \mb{s} + 2S^zh }}
\eeq
where \il{\ham_0} is the kinetic energy of the disentangled electrons and \il{h = \hf\sum_{k>\Lambda^*} J_k s^z_k}.
\beq
\rho &= \rho_0 \exp\qq{-\beta\rr{J^* \mb{S}\cdot \mb{s} + 2S^zh }}\\
\rho_\text{eff} &= \rho_0 \text{Tr}_\text{imp+cloud}\exp\qq{-\beta\rr{J^* \mb{S}\cdot \mb{s} + 2S^zh }}
\eeq
To take the trace, we diagonalize the matrix:
\beq
J^* \mb{S}\cdot \mb{s} + 2S^zh &= \bordermatrix{~ & \ket{\ua\ua}& \ket{\ua\da}& \ket{\da\ua}& \ket{\da\da}\\~&h+\fr{J^*}{4} &&&\\~&&h-\fr{J^*}{4}&\fr{J^*}{2}&\\~&&\fr{J^*}{2}&-h-\fr{J^*}{4}&\\~&&&&-h+\fr{J^*}{4}}\\
			       &\ra\bordermatrix{~ & \ket{\ua\ua}& \ket{\ua\da} + \ket{\da\ua}& \ket{\ua\da} - \ket{\da\ua}& \ket{\da\da}\\~&h+\fr{J^*}{4} &&&\\~&&-\fr{J^*}{4}+A&&\\~&&&-\fr{J^*}{4}-A&\\~&&&&-h+\fr{J^*}{4}}\\
\eeq
where \il{A = \sqrt{h^2 + \rr{\fr{J^*}{2}}^2}}.
We can now take the trace by exponentiating this matrix:
\beq
\exp\qq{-\beta\rr{J^* \mb{S}\cdot \mb{s} + 2S^zh}} &=\bordermatrix{~ & \ket{\ua\ua}& \ket{\ua\da} + \ket{\da\ua}& \ket{\ua\da} - \ket{\da\ua}& \ket{\da\da}\\~&e^{-\beta\rr{h+\fr{J^*}{4}}} &&&\\~&&e^{-\beta\rr{-\fr{J^*}{4}+A}}&&\\~&&&e^{-\beta\rr{-\fr{J^*}{4}-A}}&\\~&&&&e^{-\beta\rr{-h+\fr{J^*}{4}}}}\\
\implies \text{Tr} \qq{e^{-\beta\rr{J^* \mb{S}\cdot \mb{s} + 2S^zh}}} &= e^{-\beta\fr{J^*}{4}}2\cosh \beta h + e^{\beta\fr{J^*}{4}}2\cosh A\beta
\eeq
In the limit of low temperature (\il{\beta \to \infty}), we have \il{e^{-\beta\fr{J^*}{4}} \to 0} and \il{\cosh A\beta \to e^{A\beta}}.
We can then write
\beq
\rho_\text{eff} = \rho_0 \text{Tr} \qq{e^{-\beta\rr{J^* \mb{S}\cdot \mb{s} + 2S^zh}}} = \ex{-\beta\qq{\ham_0 - \fr{J^*}{4} - A}} \equiv \ex{-\beta \ham_\text{eff}}
\eeq
The effective Hamiltonian for the disentangled electrons is thus
\beq
\ham_\text{eff} = \ham_0 - \fr{J^*}{4} - A &= \ham_0 - \fr{J^*}{4} - \sqrt{h^2 + \rr{\fr{J^*}{2}}^2}\\
					   &=\ham_0 - \fr{J^*}{4} - \fr{J^*}{2}\sqrt{1 + \rr{\fr{2h}{J^*}}^2}\\
					   &=\ham_0 - \fr{J^*}{4} - \fr{J^*}{2} -  \fr{h^2}{J^*} + ...\\
					   &\approx\sum_{k>\Lambda^*,\sigma}\epsilon_k \hat n_{k\sigma} - \fr{3J^*}{4} - \fr{h^2}{J^*}\\
					   &=\sum_{k>\Lambda^*,\sigma}\epsilon_k \hat n_{k\sigma} - \fr{3J^*}{4} - \fr{1}{J^*}{\sum_{k,q>\Lambda^*}J^k J^q s^z_k s^z_q} \\
\eeq
Recognizing the constant negative energy as the Kondo singlet ground state energy and noting that since the \il{\Lambda^k} falls sharply as  we move away from \il{\Lambda^*}, we can truncate the second sum at the first shell \il{\Lambda^*}, we obtain the Hamiltonian for the local Fermi liquid.
\beq
\ham_{LFL} & = \epsilon_* \sum_{k=\Lambda^*,\sigma} \hat n_{k\sigma} - J^*\sum_{k,q=\Lambda^*}s^z_{k}s^z_{q}
\eeq
LFL stands for local Fermi liquid; it is the Hamiltonian closest to the cloud.
 We now consider quasiparticle excitations \il{\delta n_{k\sigma}}.
The ground state energy is
\beq
E_0 &= \epsilon_* \sum_{k=\Lambda^*,\sigma}  n_{k\sigma} - J^*\sum_{k,q=\Lambda^*}s^z_{k}s^z_{q}\\
    &= \epsilon_* \sum_{k=\Lambda^*,\sigma}  n_{k\sigma} - \fr{J^*}{4}\sum_{k,q=\Lambda^*}\rr{n_{k\ua} - n_{k\da}}\rr{n_{q\ua} - n_{q\da}}\\
    &= \epsilon_* \sum_{k=\Lambda^*,\sigma}  n_{k\sigma} - \fr{J^*}{4}\sum_{k,q=\Lambda^*,\sigma}n_{k\sigma}\rr{n_{q\sigma} - n_{q\overline\sigma}}\\
\eeq
The excited energy is
\beq
E &= \epsilon_* \sum_{k=\Lambda^*,\sigma} \rr{n_{k\sigma} + \delta n_{k\sigma}} - \fr{J^*}{4}\sum_{k,q=\Lambda^*}\rr{n_{k\sigma} + \delta n_{k\sigma}}\rr{n_{q\sigma} - n_{q\overline\sigma} + \delta n_{q\sigma}- \delta n_{q\overline\sigma}}\\
  &=E_0 + \epsilon_* \sum_{k=\Lambda^*,\sigma} \delta n_{k\sigma} - \\
  &\quad\fr{J^*}{4}\sum_{k,q=\Lambda^*}\qq{n_{k\sigma}\rr{ \delta n_{q\sigma}- \delta n_{q\overline\sigma}} + \delta n_{k\sigma}\rr{n_{q\sigma} - n_{q\overline\sigma}} + \delta n_{k\sigma}\rr{ \delta n_{q\sigma}- \delta n_{q\overline\sigma}}}\\
&=E_0 + \epsilon_* \sum_{k=\Lambda^*,\sigma} \delta n_{k\sigma} - \fr{J^*}{4}\sum_{k,q=\Lambda^*}\qq{2n_{k\sigma}\rr{ \delta n_{q\sigma}- \delta n_{q\overline\sigma}} + \delta n_{k\sigma}\rr{ \delta n_{q\sigma}- \delta n_{q\overline\sigma}}}\\
\eeq
Therefore, the energy of one quasiparticle is
\beq[quasi]
\xi_{k\sigma} = \fr{\delta E}{\delta n_{k\sigma}} &= \epsilon_* - \fr{J^*}{4}\sum_{q=\Lambda^*}\qq{2n_{q\sigma} -2n_{q\ol\sigma} + \delta n_{q\sigma} - \delta n_{q\ol\sigma} + \delta n_{q\sigma} - \delta n_{q\ol \sigma}}\\
		    &=\epsilon_* - \fr{J^*}{2}\sum_{q=\Lambda^*}\qq{n_{q\sigma} -n_{q\ol\sigma} + \delta n_{q\sigma} - \delta n_{q\ol\sigma} }\\
\eeq
Assuming that the Kondo cloud imparts an interaction of the form \il{Un_\ua n_\da} to the LFL, the self energy will have only antiferromagnetic terms:
\beq
\xi_{k\sigma} = \epsilon_* + \fr{J^*}{2}\sum_{q=\Lambda^*}\qq{n_{q\ol\sigma} + \delta n_{q\ol\sigma} }
\eeq
Due to scattering from impurity, the local Fermi liquid electrons suffer a phase shift \il{\delta_{k\sigma}}, such that there spherical wave wavefunctions are of the form
\beq
\psi(\mb{r}) \sim \fr{1}{r}\sin\rr{\mb{k}\cdot\mb{r} + \delta_{k\sigma}}
\eeq
Open boundary conditions ensure
\beq
\mb{k}\cdot\mb{R} + \delta_{k\sigma} = n\pi \implies k = \fr{n\pi - \delta_{k\sigma}}{R}
\eeq
We thus see that as a result of the scattering, the momentum eigenvalues change by \il{\Delta k = -\fr{1}{R}\delta_{k\sigma}}.
This will change \il{E_k} by
\beq
\Delta E_k = \pd{E_k}{k}\Delta_k = -\fr{\delta_{k\sigma}}{R}\pd{E_k}{k}
\eeq
The total energy in presence of scattering is thus
\beq
\xi_{k\sigma} = E_k - \fr{\delta_{k\sigma}}{R}\pd{E_k}{k}
\eeq
Comparing with eq.~\ref{quasi} and noting that \il{E_k = \epsilon_*} is the bare kinetic energy, we get
\beq[phase]
\fr{\delta_{k\sigma}}{R}\pd{E_k}{k} = -\fr{J^*}{2}\sum_{q=\Lambda^*}\qq{n_{q\ol\sigma}+ \delta n_{q\ol\sigma}}\\
\eeq
The quantity \il{\pd{E_k}{k}} is calculated as
\beq
dE_k &\equiv E_{\mb{k}+\mb{dk}} - E_k \\
     &= -2t\qq{\cos \rr{k_x +dk} + \cos \rr{k_y+dk}} +2t\qq{\cos \rr{k_x} + \cos \rr{k_y}}\\
     &=2t dk\rr{\sin k_x + \sin k_y}
\eeq
Close to the Fermi surface, \il{\rr{\sin k_x + \sin k_y} \approx k_{Fx} + k_{Fy}}.
Therfore,
\beq
\pd{E_k}{k} = 2t \rr{k_{Fx} + k_{Fy}}
\eeq
Defining \il{\Delta \epsilon \equiv 2t \rr{k_{Fx} + k_{Fy}} \fr{\pi}R}, we can write eq.~\ref{phase} as
\beq
\fr{\delta_{k\sigma}}{\pi}\Delta \epsilon &= -\fr{J^*}{2}\sum_{q=\Lambda^*}\qq{n_{q\ol\sigma}+ \delta n_{q\ol\sigma}}\\
\implies \delta_{k\sigma} &= -\fr{\pi J^*}{2 \Delta \epsilon}\sum_{q=\Lambda^*}\qq{n_{q\ol\sigma}+ \delta n_{q\ol\sigma}}
\eeq
We can expand the phase shift as a function of the quasiparticle energy and the quasiparticle distribution, around \il{n_{k\sigma} = n^{(0)}_{k\sigma}} and \il{\epsilon_* = E_F}:
\beq
\delta_{k\sigma} &= \delta_{k\sigma}(n^{(0)},E_F) + \pd{\delta_{k\sigma}}{\epsilon_*}\rr{\epsilon_* - E_F} + \sum_q \pd{\delta_{k\sigma}}{n_{q\ol\sigma}}\delta n_{q\ol\sigma}\\
		 &=\fr{\pi}{2} + \alpha\rr{\epsilon_* - E_F} + \Phi\sum_q \delta n_{q\ol\sigma}\\
\eeq
From here on, Nozières' calculation gives the value of Wilson ratio.
\subsection{Calculation of susceptibility from partition function}
The susceptibility can be calculated from the impurity partition function \il{Z_\text{imp}}, eq.~\ref{suscep}:
\beq
\chi_\text{imp} = \lim_{B \to 0}\fr{1}{Z_\text{imp}^2\beta}\qq{Z_\text{imp}\fr{\partial^2 Z_\text{imp}}{\partial B^2} - \rr{\pd{Z_\text{imp}}{B}}^2}
\eeq
To calculate \il{Z_\text{imp}}, we will use the Hamiltonian of the impurity+cloud:
\beq
\ham_K = J^* \mb{S}\cdot\mb{s} + hS^z
\eeq
In the presence of a magnetic field on the impurity, the Hamiltonian becomes
\beq[fieldh]
\ham_K(B) &= J^* \mb{S}\cdot\mb{s} + hS^z + BS^z\\
	  &=J^* \mb{S}\cdot\mb{s} + B^\prime S^z\\
\eeq
where \il{B = J^*\sum_k s^z_k} and \il{h} is an external field.
 \il{B^\prime = B+h} is the total field on the impurity spin.
We can write the expression for susceptibility in terms of this total field:
\beq
\chi_\text{imp} = \lim_{B^\prime \to h}\fr{1}{Z_\text{imp}^2\beta}\qq{Z_\text{imp}\fr{\partial^2 Z_\text{imp}}{\partial {B^\prime}^2} - \rr{\pd{Z_\text{imp}}{B^\prime}}^2}
\eeq
From eq.~\ref{fieldh}, we can write the partition function:
\beq
Z_\text{imp} = 2e^{\fr{\beta J^*}{4}}\qq{\cosh \fr{\beta B^\prime}{2} + \cosh\rr{\fr{\beta}{2}\sqrt{{B^\prime}^2 + J^2}}}
\eeq
Since the \il{2e^{\fr{\beta J^*}{4}}} factor in front will remain unaffected by the derivatives and will get canceled from numerator and denominator while calculating \il{\chi}, I will drop that henceforth.
\beq
Z_\text{imp}&=\cosh \fr{\beta B^\prime}{2} + \cosh\rr{\fr{\beta}{2}\sqrt{{B^\prime}^2 + J^2}}\\
Z_\text{imp}^2&=\cosh \fr{\beta B^\prime}{2} + \cosh^2\rr{\fr{\beta}{2}\sqrt{{B^\prime}^2 + J^2}} + 2\cosh \fr{\beta B^\prime}{2}\cosh\rr{\fr{\beta}{2}\sqrt{{B^\prime}^2 + J^2}}\\
	\pd{Z_\text{imp}}{B^\prime} &= \fr{\beta}{2}\qq{\sinh \fr{\beta B^\prime}{2} + \fr{B^\prime}{\sqrt{{B^\prime}^2 + J^2}} \sinh\rr{\fr{\beta}{2}\sqrt{{{B^\prime}^2 + J^2}}}}
\eeq
\beq[zsq]
	\rr{\pd{Z_\text{imp}}{B^\prime}}^2 &= \rr{\fr{\beta}{2}}^2\left\{\sinh^2 \fr{\beta B^\prime}{2} + \fr{{B^\prime}^2}{{B^\prime}^2 + J^2} \sinh^2\rr{\fr{\beta}{2}\sqrt{{{B^\prime}^2 + J^2}}}\right.
\\&\quad+ \left.2\sinh \fr{\beta B^\prime}{2}\fr{B^\prime}{\sqrt{{B^\prime}^2 + J^2}} \sinh\rr{\fr{\beta}{2}\sqrt{{{B^\prime}^2 + J^2}}}\right\}
\eeq
\beq
	\pd{{}^2Z_\text{imp}}{{B^\prime}^2} &= \rr{\fr{\beta}{2}}^2\left\{\cosh \fr{\beta B^\prime}{2} + \fr{{B^\prime}^2}{{B^\prime}^2 + J^2} \cosh\rr{\fr{\beta}{2}\sqrt{{{B^\prime}^2 + J^2}}}\right.\\&\quad+\left.\fr{2}{\beta}\fr{J^2}{\rr{J^2 + {B^\prime}^2}^\fr{3}{2}}\sinh\rr{\fr{\beta}{2}\sqrt{{{B^\prime}^2 + J^2}}}\right\}
\eeq
\beq
	Z_\text{imp}\pd{{}^2Z_\text{imp}}{{B^\prime}^2} &=\rr{\fr{\beta}{2}}^2\left\{\cosh^2\fr{\beta B^\prime}{2} + \cosh\fr{\beta B^\prime}{2}\cosh\rr{\fr{\beta}{2}\sqrt{J^2 + {B^\prime}^2}} \right.\\
							&\quad\left.+ Z_\text{imp}\fr{{B^\prime}^2}{{B^\prime}^2 + J^2} \cosh\rr{\fr{\beta}{2}\sqrt{{{B^\prime}^2 + J^2}}} \right.\\
							&\quad\left.+ Z_\text{imp}\fr{2}{\beta}\fr{J^2}{\rr{J^2 + {B^\prime}^2}^\fr{3}{2}}\sinh\rr{\fr{\beta}{2}\sqrt{{{B^\prime}^2 + J^2}}}\right\}
\eeq
The total expression is
\begin{gather}
\chi_\text{imp} = \fr{\beta\sigma_1 + \fr{2\sinh \sigma_2}{\sqrt{\sigma_3}} + \fr{B^2 \beta\cosh\sigma_2 }{\sigma_3} - \fr{2B^2\sinh\sigma_2}{\sigma_3^\fr{3}{2}}}{4\rr{\cosh \sigma_2 + \sigma_1}}-\qq{\fr{\fr{\sinh\fr{\beta B}{2}}{2} + \fr{B\sinh \sigma_2}{2\sqrt{\sigma_3}}}{\cosh \sigma_2 + \sigma_1}^2}^2\\
\sigma_1 = \cosh \fr{\beta B}{2}, \sigma_3 = B^2 + {J^*}^2, \sigma_2 = \fr{\beta\sqrt{\sigma_3}}{2}
\end{gather}
In the absence of LFL magnetization, we can set \il{B=0}.
Then eq.~\ref{zsq} vanishes and what remains is
\begin{gather}
Z_\text{imp} = 1 + \cosh \fr{\beta J^*}{2}\\
\pd{{}^2Z_\text{imp}}{{B^\prime}^2} = \rr{\fr{\beta}{2}}^2\qq{1 + \fr{2}{\beta J^*}\sinh\rr{\fr{\beta J^*}{2}}} = \fr{\beta}{2}\qq{\fr{\beta}{2} + \fr{1}{J^*}\sinh\rr{\fr{\beta J^*}{2}}}\\
\chi_\text{imp} = \fr{1}{\beta Z_\text{imp}}\pd{{}^2Z_\text{imp}}{{B^\prime}^2} =\fr{\beta + \fr{2}{J^*}\sinh\rr{\fr{\beta J^*}{2}}}{4\rr{1 + \cosh \fr{\beta J^*}{2}}}
\end{gather}
The Wilson ratio is defined as \il{W \equiv 4T_K \chi(T=0)}.
It turns out to be
\beq
	W &= \lim_{\beta \to \infty} 4T_K \fr{\beta + \fr{2}{J^*}\ex{\fr{\beta J^*}{2}}}{4\rr{1 + \ex{\fr{\beta J^*}{2}}}}\\ 
	  &= \lim_{\beta \to \infty} 4T_K \fr{\fr{2}{J^*}\ex{\fr{\beta J^*}{2}}}{4\ex{\fr{\beta J^*}{2}}}\\ 
	  &= \fr{2T_K}{J^*}
\eeq
The quantity \il{\fr{\chi}{\beta}} saturates to a certain value at large temperature:
\beq
	\fr{ \chi}{\beta}(\beta \to 0) &=\lim_{\beta \to 0} \fr{1}{8}\rr{1 + \fr{2}{J^*}\fr{\sinh \fr{\beta J^*}{2}}{\beta}}\\
				       &= \fr{1}{4}
\eeq
\subsection{Effective Hamiltonian of Kondo cloud}
To study the excitations of the Kondo cloud, we look at the Hamiltonian of impurity+cloud:
\beq
\ham^* = \sum_{k<\Lambda^*,\sigma} \epsilon_k \hat n_{k\sigma} + J^* \mb{S}\cdot\mb{s} = \ham_0^* + J^* \mb{S}\cdot\mb{s}
\eeq
In order to separate the cloud from the impurity, take the groundstate wavefunction of \il{\ham^*}:
\beq
\ket{\Psi} = a_\da \ket{\ua_\text{imp}}\ket{\Downarrow} + a_\ua\ket{\da_\text{imp}}\ket{\Uparrow} 
\eeq
Note that \il{\ket{\Uparrow},\ket{\Downarrow}} are many-electron states.
The eigenvalue equation for this state is
\beq
	\fr{1}{J^*}\rr{E_0 - \ham^*_0}\ket{\Psi} &= \rr{S^z s^z + \hf S^+s^- + \hf S^- s^+}\rr{a_\da \ket{\ua_\text{imp}}\ket{\Downarrow} + a_\ua\ket{\da_\text{imp}}\ket{\Uparrow}}\\
						 &=\fr{s^z}{2}\rr{a_\da \ket{\ua_\text{imp}}\ket{\Downarrow} - a_\ua\ket{\da_\text{imp}} \ket{\Uparrow}} + a_\da \ket{\da_\text{imp}}\fr{s^+}{2}\ket{\Downarrow} + a_\ua \ket{\ua_\text{imp}}\fr{s^-}{2} \ket{\Uparrow}
\eeq
Comparing the coefficients of \il{\ket{\ua_\text{imp}}} and \il{\ket{\da_\text{imp}}}, we get
\beq[coupled]
	\fr{1}{J^*}\rr{E_0 - \ham^*_0}a_\da\ket{\Downarrow} &= \fr{s^z}{2}a_\da \ket{\Downarrow} + a_\ua \fr{s^-}{2} \ket{\Uparrow}\\
	\fr{1}{J^*}\rr{E_0 - \ham^*_0}a_\ua\ket{\Uparrow} &= -\fr{s^z}{2}a_\ua \ket{\Uparrow} + a_\da \fr{s^+}{2} \ket{\Downarrow}
\eeq
From the first equation, we can isolate \il{\ket{\Downarrow}}:
\beq
\ket{\Downarrow} = \qq{\fr{1}{J^*}\rr{E_0 - \ham^*_0} - \fr{s^z}{2}}^{-1}\fr{a_\ua}{a_\da} s^-\ket{\Uparrow}
\eeq
Substituting this in the second equation gives
\beq[effeig]
	\fr{1}{J^*}\rr{E_0-\ham^*_0}\ket{\Uparrow} &= -\fr{s^z}{2}\ket{\Uparrow} + \hf s^+ \qq{\fr{1}{J^*}\rr{E_0-\ham^*_0}-\fr{s^z}{2}}^{-1} s^-\ket{\Uparrow}\\
\rr{E_0 - \ham^*_0}\ket{\Uparrow} &= \qq{-\fr{J^*}{2}s^z + \rr{\fr{J^*}{2}}^2s^+ \fr{1}{\rr{E_0 - \ham^*_0} - \fr{J^*}{2}s^z}s^-}\ket{\Uparrow}\\
			     &\equiv \ham_\text{eff}\ket{\Uparrow}
\eeq
Now we can simplify the effective Hamiltonian for the Kondo cloud.
First put \il{E_0=0} and \il{s^z=\hf}.
The latter is obvious from the fact that this is the effective Hamiltonian for the up-spin state.
The justification for the former will be given later.
Then,
\beq
H_\text{eff} &= -\fr{J^*}{4} -\rr{\fr{J^*}{2}}^2s^+ \fr{1}{\fr{J^*}{4}+\ham^*_0 }s^-\\
	     &=-\fr{J^*}{4} - J^*s^+ \fr{1}{1+\fr{4\ham^*_0}{J^*} }s^-\\
\eeq
We can expand the denominator in a power series:
\beq
\fr{1}{1+\fr{4\ham^*_0}{J^*}} = 1 - \fr{4\ham^*_0}{J^*} + \fr{16}{{J^*}^2}{\ham^*_0}^2
\eeq
Substituting this gives
\beq[heff]
H_\text{eff}&=-\fr{J^*}{4} - J^*s^+ \rr{1 - \fr{4\ham^*_0}{J^*} + \fr{16}{{J^*}^2}{\ham^*_0}^2}s^-\\
	    &=-\fr{J^*}{4} - J^*s^+s^-  + 4s^+ \ham^*_0 s^-  - \fr{16}{{J^*}}s^+{\ham^*_0}^2s^-\\
\eeq
Now we simplify the terms individually:
\beq
s^+ s^- &= \hf + s^z = 1\\
\implies -\fr{J^*}{4} - J^*s^+ s^- &= -\fr{J^*}{4} -J^* = -\fr{5J^*}{4}\\
4s^+ \ham^*_0 s^- &= 4s^+s^-\ham_0^* + 4s^+\qq{\ham^*_0,s^-} = 4\ham_0^* + 4s^+\qq{\ham^*_0,s^-}\\
-\fr{16}{{J^*}}s^+{\ham^*_0}^2s^- &= - \fr{16}{{J^*}}s^+\ham_0^*\rr{s^- \ham_0^* + \qq{\ham_0^*,s^-}} \\
				   &= - \fr{16}{{J^*}}\rr{s^+\ham_0^*\qq{\ham_0^*,s^-} + {\ham_0^*}^2 + s^+\qq{\ham_0^*,s^-}\ham_0^*}\\
				   &= - \fr{16}{{J^*}}\rr{{\ham_0^*}^2 + s^+\cc{\ham_0^*,\qq{\ham^*_0,s^-}}}
\eeq
We can calculate the commutator by looking at the expression of \il{s^-} from eq.~\ref{sminus}: \il{s^- = \sum_{k_1,k_2}c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\ua}}.
Using the identities
\beq
\qq{n_{k\sigma},c^\dagger_{k_1\da}} &= c^\dagger_{k\da}\delta_{kk_1}\delta_{\sigma,\da}\\
\qq{n_{k\sigma},c_{k_2\ua}} &= -c_{k\ua}\delta_{kk_2}\delta_{\sigma,\ua}
\eeq
the commutator becomes
\beq
\qq{\ham^*_0, s^-} &= \sum_{k,k_1,k_2,\sigma}\epsilon_k\qq{n_{k\sigma},c^\dagger_{k_1,\da}c_{k_2,\ua}}\\
		   &= \sum_{k,k_1,k_2,\sigma}\epsilon_k\cc{-c^\dagger_{k_1\da} c_{k\ua}\delta_{kk_2}\delta_{\sigma\ua} + c^\dagger_{k\da}\delta_{kk_1}\delta_{\sigma,\da}c_{k_2\ua}}\\
		   &= \sum_{k_1 k_2}c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\ua}\rr{\epsilon_{k_1} - \epsilon_{k_2}}
\eeq
\beq
4s^+\qq{\ham^*_0,s^-} &= 4\sum_{k_1 k_2 k_3 k_4}c^\dagger_{k_3\ua}c_{k_4\da}c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\ua}\rr{\epsilon_{k_1} - \epsilon_{k_2}}\\
\cc{\ham_0^*,\qq{\ham^*_0, s^-}} &= \sum_{k,\sigma,k_1 k_2}\epsilon_k\rr{\epsilon_{k_1} - \epsilon_{k_2}}\cc{n_{k\sigma},c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\da}}\\
				 &= \sum_{k,\sigma,k_1 k_2}\epsilon_k\rr{\epsilon_{k_1} - \epsilon_{k_2}}\cc{n_{k\sigma},c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\da}}\\
\eeq
To simplify this anticommutator, note
\beq
c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\ua}n_{k\sigma} &= c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\ua}c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c_{k\sigma}\\
					&= c^\dagger_{k_1\da}\rr{\delta_{kk_2}\delta_{\sigma\ua} - c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c_{k_2\ua}}c_{k\sigma}\\
&= \delta_{kk_2}\delta_{\sigma\ua}c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k\sigma}+ c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\ua}c_{k\sigma}\\
&= \delta_{kk_2}\delta_{\sigma\ua}c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\ua}- c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k\sigma}c_{k_2\ua}\\
&= \delta_{kk_2}\delta_{\sigma\ua}c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\ua}- c^\dagger_{k\sigma}\rr{\delta_{kk_1}\delta_{\sigma\da} -c_{k\sigma}c^\dagger_{k_1\da}}c_{k_2\ua}\\
&= \rr{\delta_{kk_2}\delta_{\sigma\ua} - \delta_{kk_1}\delta_{\sigma\da}}c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\ua} + n_{k\sigma}c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\ua}\\
\implies \cc{n_{k\sigma},c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\ua}} &= \qq{\rr{\delta_{kk_2}\delta_{\sigma\ua} - \delta_{kk_1}\delta_{\sigma\da}} + 2n_{k\sigma}}c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\ua}
\eeq
Therefore,
\beq
\cc{\ham_0^*,\qq{\ham^*_0, s^-}} &= \sum_{k,\sigma,k_1 k_2}\epsilon_k\rr{\epsilon_{k_1} - \epsilon_{k_2}}\qq{\delta_{kk_2}\delta_{\sigma\ua} - \delta_{kk_1}\delta_{\sigma\da} + 2n_{k\sigma}}c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\ua}\\
				 &= \sum_{k,k_1 k_2}\rr{\epsilon_{k_1} - \epsilon_{k_2}}\qq{\delta_{kk_2} \epsilon_{k_2}- \delta_{kk_1}\epsilon_{k_1}+ 2\epsilon_k\sum_\sigma n_{k\sigma}}c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\ua}\\
				 &= \sum_{k_1 k_2}\rr{\epsilon_{k_1} - \epsilon_{k_2}}\qq{\epsilon_{k_2}- \epsilon_{k_1}+ 2\sum_{k\sigma}\epsilon_k n_{k\sigma}}c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\ua}\\
				 &\approx -\sum_{k_1 k_2}\rr{\epsilon_{k_1} - \epsilon_{k_2}}^2c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\ua} \\
\implies s^+\cc{\ham_0^*,\qq{\ham^*_0, s^-}} &= -\sum_{k_1 k_2 k_3 k_4}\rr{\epsilon_{k_1} - \epsilon_{k_2}}^2c^\dagger_{k_3\ua}c_{k_4\da}c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\ua} \\\eeq
These give
\beq
4s^+ \ham^*_0 s^- &= 4{\ham_0^*}^2 + 4\sum_{k_1 k_2 k_3 k_4}c^\dagger_{k_3\ua}c_{k_4\da}c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\ua}\rr{\epsilon_{k_1} - \epsilon_{k_2}}\\
-\fr{16}{{J^*}}s^+{\ham^*_0}^2s^- &= -\fr{16}{J^*}{\ham_0^*}^2 +\fr{16}{J^*}\sum_{k_1 k_2 k_3 k_4}\rr{\epsilon_{k_1} - \epsilon_{k_2}}^2c^\dagger_{k_3\ua}c_{k_4\da}c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\ua}
\eeq
The effective Hamiltonian eq.~\ref{heff} is then
\beq
H_\text{eff} = - \fr{5J^*}{4} +  4\ham_0^* -\fr{16}{J^*}{\ham_0^*}^2 + \sum_{k_1 k_2 k_3 k_4}\qq{4\rr{\epsilon_{k_1} - \epsilon_{k_2}} + \fr{16}{J^*}\rr{\epsilon_{k_1} - \epsilon_{k_2}}^2}c^\dagger_{k_3\ua}c_{k_4\da}c^\dagger_{k_1\da}c_{k_2\ua}
\eeq
This is the effective Kondo cloud Hamiltonian for the state \il{\ket{\Uparrow}}.
\pb
We can also evaluate the effective Hamiltonian for the orthogonal state \il{\ket{\Downarrow}}.
First we solve the coupled set of eqs.~\ref{coupled} to eliminate \il{\ket{\Uparrow}}:
\beq
\ket{\Uparrow} &= \qq{\fr{1}{J^*}\rr{E_0 - \ham^*_0} + \fr{s^z}{2}}^{-1}\fr{a_\da}{a_\ua} \fr{s^+}{2}\ket{\Downarrow}\\
\implies  \rr{E_0 - \ham^*_0}\ket{\Downarrow} &= \qq{\fr{J^*}{2}s^z + \rr{\fr{J^*}{2}}^2s^- \fr{1}{\rr{E_0 - \ham^*_0} + \fr{J^*}{2}s^z}s^+}\ket{\Downarrow}
\eeq
Again substituting \il{E=0} and \il{s^z = -\hf} gives
\beq
H_\text{eff} &= -\fr{J^*}{4} - \rr{\fr{J^*}{2}}^2s^- \fr{1}{\ham^*_0 + \fr{J^*}{4}}s^+\\
	     &= -\fr{J^*}{4} - J^* s^- \fr{1}{1 + \fr{4\ham^*_0}{J^*}}s^+\\
	     &= -\fr{J^*}{4} - J^* s^- \rr{1 - \fr{4\ham^*_0}{J^*} + \fr{16}{{J^*}^2}{\ham^*_0}^2}s^+\\
	     &= -\fr{J^*}{4} - J^* s^-s^+ + 4s^-\ham^*_0s^+ - \fr{16}{J^*}s^- {\ham_0^*}^2 s^+ \\
	     &= -\fr{J^*}{4} - J^*\rr{\hf-s^z}  + 4s^-\ham^*_0s^+ - \fr{16}{J^*}s^- {\ham_0^*}^2 s^+ \\
	     &= -\fr{5J^*}{4} + 4\qq{\ham_0^* + \sum\rr{\epsilon_{k_1} - \epsilon_{k_2}}c^\dagger_{k_3\da}c_{k_4\ua}c^\dagger_{k_1\ua}c_{k_2\da}} \\
	     &\quad- \fr{16}{J^*}\qq{{\ham_0^*}^2 + \sum\rr{\epsilon_{k_1}^2 - \epsilon_{k_2}^2}c^\dagger_{k_3\da}c_{k_4\ua}c^\dagger_{k_1\ua}c_{k_2\da}} \\
	     &= -\fr{5J^*}{4} + 4\ham_0^* -\fr{16}{J^*}{\ham_0^*}^2 + \sum\qq{4\rr{\epsilon_{k_1} - \epsilon_{k_2}}+ \fr{16}{J^*}\rr{\epsilon_{k_2}^2 - \epsilon_{k_1}^2}}c^\dagger_{k_3\da}c_{k_4\ua}c^\dagger_{k_1\ua}c_{k_2\da} \\
\eeq
\subsection*{Justification for the choice \il{E=0}}
We want to look at the excitations of the Kondo model in the ground state of the cloud+impurity composite system.
If we assume that a single localized impurity cannot destabilize the Fermi surface of the Kondo cloud electrons, the total energy of composite system must be greater than zero.
Otherwise, the total system will come below the Fermi surface to form a bound system and the Fermi surface will get destabilized.
Consequently, the minimum energy of the composite system has to be \il{E_0 = 0}.
\pb
The requirement that the total energy of the composite system be zero constrains the kinetic energy of the Kondo cloud.
This is understood by noting that from eq.~\ref{fixham}, the Hamiltonian of Kondo+impurity part is \il{\ham_0^* + \mb{S}\cdot\mb{s}}.
This should give an eigenvalue of 0 in the ground state.
The second term in the Hamiltonian acting on the singlet state gives \il{-\fr{3J^*}{2}}.
Therefore, we get
\begin{gather}
\ham_0^* -\fr{3J^*}{2} = E_0 = 0 \\
\implies \ham_0^s = \fr{3J^*}{2}
\end{gather}
This is the minimum value of the kinetic energy for the Kondo cloud Hamiltonian; anything lower than this would lead to a total energy \il{E_0} less than 0 and the destabilization of the Fermi surface.
This tells us that just as one electron comes below the Fermi surface to form the singlet with the impurity spin, other electrons have to excite suitably above the Fermi surface (that is, become more energetic) in order to constrain the ground state energy at 0.
Excitations of the cloud then involve higher values of \il{\ham_0^* > \fr{3J^*}{2}} and lead to excitations of the composite system as a whole (\il{E_0 > 0}).
The spectrum of \il{\ham^*_0} can then be thought to be gapped; the kinetic energy must start from a non-zero value.
It is not possible to have a kinetic energy infinitesimally close to the Fermi surface.

\subsection*{One electron on shell}
At first order, the rotated Hamiltonian is
\beq
\ham_{j-1} = 2^{-n_j}\text{Tr}_{1,2,...,n_j}\ham_j + \sum_{q\beta}\tau_{q\beta}\cc{c^\dagger_{q\beta}\text{Tr}_{q\beta}\rr{\ham c_{q\beta}},\eta_{q\beta}}
\eeq
\il{n_j} is the number of states on the shell \il{\Lambda_j}.
We take the full Hamiltonian as our \il{\ham_j}.
Since this is the first step of the RG, the shell being decoupled is the highest one, which we call \il{\Lambda_N}.

\paragraph{Calculation of first term}
The first term, the initial trace, is a sequential trace over all the states on the shell being disentangled.
At each trace, we consider only electrons on the current degree of freedom and on shells below the current shell:
\beq
\hf\text{Tr}_{q\ua} \ham_j &= \sum_{k<\Lambda_N,\sigma}\epsilon_k \hat n_{k\sigma} + \epsilon_{d}\sum_\sigma  \hat n_{d\sigma} +  U \hat n_{d\ua} \hat n_{d\da} + \hf\text{Tr}_{q\ua}\cc{\epsilon_k \hat n_{q\ua}}\\

\paragraph{Calculation of second term}
The second term involves some other traces:
\beq
\text{Tr}_{q\beta}\rr{\ham c_{q\beta}} &= \sum_{k\sigma} V_k \text{Tr}_{q\beta}\rr{c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c_{d\sigma}c_{q\beta}}\\
				       &= \sum_{k\sigma} V_k c_{d\sigma}\delta_{\sigma\beta}\delta_{kq}\\
				       &= V_q c_{d\beta}\\
\text{Tr}_{q\beta}\rr{c_{q\beta}^\dagger \ham } &= V^*_q c^\dagger_{d\beta}
\eeq
\beq
\ham^D &= \sum_{k\sigma}\epsilon_k \hat n_{k\sigma} + \epsilon_{d}\sum_\sigma  \hat n_{d\sigma} +  U \hat n_{d\ua} \hat n_{d\da}\\
\text{Tr}_{q\beta}\rr{\ham^D \hat n_{q\beta}} &= \sum_{k<\Lambda_N,\sigma}\epsilon_k \hat n_{k\sigma} + \epsilon_{d}\sum_\sigma  \hat n_{d\sigma} +  U \hat n_{d\ua} \hat n_{d\da} + \epsilon_q\\
\eta_{q\beta} &= \text{Tr}_{q\beta}\rr{c^\dagger_{q\beta}\ham}c_{q\beta}\fr{1}{\hat \omega - \text{Tr}_{q\beta}\rr{\ham^D \hat n_{q\beta}}\hat n_{q\beta}}\\
	      &= V^*_q c^\dagger_{d\beta}c_{q\beta}\fr{1}{\hat \omega - \rr{\sum_{k<\Lambda_N,\sigma}\epsilon_k \hat n_{k\sigma} + \epsilon_{d}\sum_\sigma  \hat n_{d\sigma} +  U \hat n_{d\ua} \hat n_{d\da} - \epsilon_q}\hat n_{q\beta}}\\
	      &= V^*_q c^\dagger_{d\beta}c_{q\beta}\fr{1}{\omega\tau_{q\beta} - \rr{\epsilon_{d}\sum_\sigma \hat n_{d\sigma} + U \hat n_{d\ua}\hat n_{d\da} + \epsilon_q}\tau_{q\beta}}\\
\eeq
At the last step, \textbf{\textcolor{red}{I replaced \il{\pmb{\hat \omega - \sum_{k<\Lambda_N,\sigma}\epsilon_k \hat n_{k\sigma}\hat n_{q\beta} - \hf\rr{\epsilon_{d}\sum_\sigma \hat n_{d\sigma} + U \hat n_{d\ua}\hat n_{d\da} + \epsilon_q} }} with \il{\pmb{\omega\tau_{q\beta}}}}}.
Note that since this term has a \il{c^\dagger_{d\beta}}, it will not vanish only when acting on a state with \il{\hat n_{d\beta} = 0}.
Hence we can drop the terms \il{\hat n_{d\ua}\hat n_{d\da}} and \il{\epsilon_{d\beta}\hat n_{d\beta}} in the denominator.
Also, since it has a \il{c_{q\beta}}, we can set the \il{\tau_{q\beta}} in the denominator to \hf.
Putting together the individual pieces, we can now write the second term:
\beq
\sum_{q\beta}\tau_{q\beta}\cc{c^\dagger_{q\beta}\text{Tr}_{q\beta}\rr{\ham c_{q\beta}},\eta_{q\beta}} &= \sum_{q\beta}\tau_{q\beta}\cc{V_q c^\dagger_{q\beta}c_{d\beta}, V^*_q c^\dagger_{d\beta}c_{q\beta}\fr{1}{\hf\rr{\omega - \epsilon_q - \epsilon_{d}\hat n_{d\ol\beta}}}}\\
&= \sum_{q\beta}2\tau_{q\beta}\cc{V_q c^\dagger_{q\beta}c_{d\beta}, V^*_q c^\dagger_{d\beta}c_{q\beta}\fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q - \epsilon_{d}\hat n_{d\ol\beta}}}
\eeq
We now note that the factor with \il{\omega} can be written as follows:
\beq
\fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q - \epsilon_{d}\hat n_{d\ol\beta}} &= \fr{\hat n_{d\ol\beta}}{\omega - \epsilon_q - \epsilon_{d}} + \fr{1 -\hat n_{d\ol\beta}}{\omega - \epsilon_q }\\
							     &= \hat n_{d\ol\beta}\fr{\epsilon_d}{\rr{\omega - \epsilon_q - \epsilon_{d}}\rr{\omega - \epsilon_q }} + \fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q }\\
\eeq
Since these terms commute with the other terms, they can be taken out of the anticommutator; what's left is
\beq
\cc{V_q c^\dagger_{q\beta}c_{d\beta}, V^*_q c^\dagger_{d\beta}c_{q\beta}} = |V_q|^2\qq{\hat n_{q\beta}\rr{1 - \hat n_{d\beta}} + \hat n_{d\beta}\rr{1 - \hat n_{q\beta}}} 
\eeq
The \il{\tau} and the \il{\hat n} can be multiplied:
\begin{gather}
	2\tau_{q\beta}\rr{1-\hat n_{q\beta}} = \rr{\hat n_{q\beta} - 1}\\
	2\tau_{q\beta}\hat n_{q\beta} = \hat n_{q\beta}
\end{gather}
The total thing becomes
\beq
\sum_{q\beta}|V_q|^2\qq{\hat n_{d\beta}\rr{\hat n_{q\beta} - 1}+ \hat n_{q\beta}\rr{1-\hat n_{d\beta}}}\qq{\hat n_{d\ol\beta}\fr{\epsilon_d}{\rr{\omega - \epsilon_q - \epsilon_{d}}\rr{\omega - \epsilon_q }} + \fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q }}\\
							     =\sum_{q\beta}|V_q|^2\qq{\hat n_{q\beta}-\hat n_{d\beta}}\qq{\hat n_{d\ol\beta}\fr{\epsilon_d}{\rr{\omega - \epsilon_q - \epsilon_{d}}\rr{\omega - \epsilon_q }} + \fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q }} 
\eeq
\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Putting \il{\hat n_{q\beta} = 1}}}, and dropping the non-operator terms, we get
\beq[term2]
\sum_{\beta}\hat n_{d\beta}\sum_q |V_q|^2\fr{\epsilon_q - \omega + 2\epsilon_{d}}{\rr{\omega - \epsilon_q}\rr{\omega - \epsilon_q - \epsilon_{d}}} -  \hat n_{d\ua}\hat n_{d\da}\sum_{q\beta}|V_q|^2\fr{\epsilon_{d}}{\rr{\omega - \epsilon_q}\rr{\omega -\epsilon_q - \epsilon_{d}}}
\eeq
The first term is the renormalization in on-site energy, \il{\sum_\beta \hat n_{d\beta}\Delta \epsilon_{d\beta}}, and the second term is the renormalization in the onsite repulsion, \il{\hat n_{d\ua}\hat n_{d\da}\Delta U}.
\paragraph{Renormalized Hamiltonian}
Combining eqs.~\ref{term1} and \ref{term2}, we get
\beq
\ham_{N-1} = \sum_{k<\Lambda_N,\sigma}\epsilon_k \hat n_{k\sigma} + \sum_{|q|=\Lambda_N}\epsilon_q +\sum_\sigma \rr{\epsilon_{d\sigma} + \Delta \epsilon_{d\sigma}} \hat n_{d\sigma} +  \rr{U + \Delta U} \hat n_{d\ua} \hat n_{d\da}
\eeq
\it{The second term is the renormalization in the kinetic energy of the disentangled electrons, the  third term is the renormalized impurity site energy and the fourth term is the renormalized onsite repulsion.}
\beq[impren]
\Delta \epsilon_{d}^{N} \equiv \epsilon_{d}\big\vert_{N-1} - \epsilon_{d}\big\vert_{N} = \sum_q |V_q|^2\fr{\epsilon_q - \omega + 2\epsilon_{d}}{\rr{\omega - \epsilon_q}\rr{\omega - \epsilon_q - \epsilon_{d}}} 
\eeq
According  to Hewson eq.~3.62 (page 68),
\beq[hewson]
\dv{\epsilon_d}{\ln D} = -\fr{\Delta}{\pi} + O(V^3)= -\rho_0 |V|^2 + O(V^3)
\eeq
in the limit of \il{U + \epsilon_d \gg D} and \il{|\epsilon_d|\ll D}, under the assumptions that \il{V_k} is independent of \il{k} and the conduction band is flat (\il{\rho(\epsilon) = \rho_0} for \il{\epsilon \in \qq{-D,D}}).
\pb
\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Assuming that we integrate out a ring at energy \il{D} and of thickness \il{-|\delta D|}, such that \il{\epsilon_q = D} everywhere on the ring}}, the number of available states is 
\beq
\delta n = \dv{n}{E} \times \delta E = \rho(D)\times |\delta D| 
\eeq
We can then replace the summation in eq.~\ref{impren} by \il{\delta n}:
\beq
\delta\epsilon_{d}(D) = |V|^2\rho(D)|\delta D| \fr{D - \omega + 2\epsilon_{d}}{\rr{\omega - D}\rr{\omega - D - \epsilon_{d}}} 
\eeq
where \il{\rho(D)} is the number of single-spin states on the shell D.
This can be compared to eq.~\ref{hewson}.
In two dimensions, the energy density of states is independent of energy.
\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Setting \il{\pmb{\omega = 0}}}}, we get 
\beq
\delta\epsilon_{d}(D) &=|V|^2\rho(D)|\delta D|\fr{D + 2\epsilon_{d}}{D\rr{D + \epsilon_{d}}}\\
		      &= |V|^2\rho(D)\fr{|\delta D|}{D}\fr{D + 2\epsilon_{d}}{D + \epsilon_{d}}\\
\eeq
I used \il{\delta D = -|\delta D|}.
Changing to continuum equation,
\beq
\dv{\epsilon_d}{\ln D} &= -\fr{\Delta}{\pi}\fr{D + 2\epsilon_{d}}{D + \epsilon_{d}}
\eeq
In the regime where the single-occupied impurity level is comfortably inside the conduction band (\il{D \gg |\epsilon_d|}), we can approximate both the numerator and denominator as simply \il{D}.
Then,
\begin{gather}
\dv{\epsilon_d}{\ln D} = -\fr{\Delta}{\pi} \\
\implies \epsilon_d + \fr{\Delta}{\pi}\log D = \text{constant}
\end{gather}
Turning to the general equation ~\ref{impren}, under the assumption of momentum-independent scattering, the continuum equation is
\beq
\dv{\epsilon_d}{\ln D} &= |V|^2n(D) \fr{\omega - D - 2\epsilon_{d}}{\rr{\omega - D}\rr{\omega - D - \epsilon_{d}}} \\
		       &= |V|^2n(D) \rr{\fr{2}{\omega - D} - \fr{1}{\omega - D - \epsilon_d}} \\
\eeq
\il{n(D)} is not the density of states, but the total number of states on the shell at energy \il{D}.
Similarly, the renormalization in \il{U} is
\beq
\delta U &= -\sum_{q\beta}|V_q|^2\fr{\epsilon_{d}}{\rr{\omega - \epsilon_q}\rr{\omega -\epsilon_q - \epsilon_{d}}}\\
		       &= -|V|^2n(D) \sum_\beta\fr{\epsilon_{d}}{\rr{\omega - D}\rr{\omega -D - \epsilon_{d}}}\\
		       &= -2|V|^2n(D) \fr{\epsilon_{d}}{\rr{\omega - D}\rr{\omega -D - \epsilon_{d}}}\\
\implies \dv{U}{\ln D} &= 2|V|^2n(D) \fr{\epsilon_{d}}{\rr{\omega - D}\rr{\omega -D - \epsilon_{d}}}\\
		       &= 2|V|^2n(D) \rr{\fr{1}{\omega - D - \epsilon_{d}} - \fr{1}{\omega - D}}
\eeq
In the penultimate step, I used the fact that since the onsite energy for either spin is same, the summation just returns a factor of 2.
\pb
\textcolor{red}{Putting \il{\omega = 0},}
\beq
\dv{\epsilon_d}{\ln D} &= |V|^2n(D) \rr{\fr{1}{D + \epsilon_d} - \fr{2}{D}} \\
\dv{U}{\ln D}	       &= 2|V|^2n(D) \rr{\fr{1}{D} - \fr{1}{D + \epsilon_d}}
\eeq

\eeq
For a better view, we can compute this Hamiltonian for the model eq.~\ref{andersonmodel}.
\beq
\hf\text{Tr}_{1}\ham &= H_0 + H_2 + \hf\epsilon_1\\
\tau_1\text{Tr}_1\rr{\ham \tau_1} &= \hf\epsilon_1\tau_1\\
\tau_{1}\cc{c^\dagger_{1}\text{Tr}_{1}\rr{\ham c_{1}},\eta_{1}} &= \tau_1 |V_1|^2\cc{c_1^\dagger c_{d\sigma_1}, c^\dagger_{d\sigma_1}c_1 \fr{1}{\hat \omega - \rr{\ham_0^D + \epsilon_2 \hat n_2 + \epsilon_1}\hat n_1}}
\eeq
Therefore,
\beq
\ham_1 = H_0 + H_2 + \hf\rr{\tau_1 + 1}\epsilon_1 + |V_1|^2\tau_1 \cc{c_1^\dagger c_{d\sigma_1}, c^\dagger_{d\sigma_1}c_1 \fr{1}{\hat \omega - \rr{\ham_0^D + \epsilon_2 \hat n_2 + \epsilon_1}\hat n_1}}
\eeq
We can write this thing as
\beq[ham22]
\ham_1 = \wl{H_0} + \epsilon_2 \hat n_2 + |V_1|^2\tau_1\cc{c_1^\dagger c_{d\sigma_1}, c^\dagger_{d\sigma_1}c_1 \fr{1}{\hat \omega - \rr{\ham_0^D + \epsilon_2 \hat n_2 + \epsilon_1}\hat n_1}} + V_2 c^\dagger_2 c_{d\sigma_2} + \text{h.c.}
\eeq
where the first term \il{\wl{H_0} = H_0 + \hf\rr{\tau_1 + 1}\epsilon_1} is the part without any 2, the second and third terms are diagonal in 2 and the final terms cause number fluctuations in 2.

The next rotated Hamiltonian is

\eeq
This can be evaluated by substituting eq.~\ref{ham22} into this expression.
For convenience later, I first compute a specific quantity:
\beq
\text{Tr}_2\rr{\ham_1^D \hat n_2} &= \wl{H}^D_0 + \epsilon_2 + |V_1|^2\tau_1\text{Tr}_2\cc{c_1^\dagger c_{d\sigma_1}, c^\dagger_{d\sigma_1}c_1 \fr{1}{\hat \omega - \rr{\ham_0^D + \epsilon_2 \hat n_2 + \epsilon_1}\hat n_1}}\\
&= \wl{H}^D_0 + \epsilon_2 + |V_1|^2\tau_1\text{Tr}_2\cc{c_1^\dagger c_{d\sigma_1}, c^\dagger_{d\sigma_1}c_1 \fr{1}{\hat \omega - \rr{\ham_0^D + \epsilon_2 \hat n_2 + \epsilon_1}\hat n_1}}\\
&= \wl{H}^D_0 + \epsilon_2 + 2|V_1|^2\tau_1\text{Tr}_2\cc{c_1^\dagger c_{d\sigma_1}, c^\dagger_{d\sigma_1}c_1 \fr{1}{ \omega - \rr{\epsilon_d \sum_\sigma\hat n_{d\sigma} + \epsilon_2 \hat n_2 + \epsilon_1}}}\\
&= \wl{H}^D_0 + \epsilon_2 + 2|V_1|^2\tau_1\cc{c_1^\dagger c_{d\sigma_1}, c^\dagger_{d\sigma_1}c_1} \text{Tr}_2\qq{\fr{1}{ \omega - \rr{\epsilon_d \sum_\sigma\hat n_{d\sigma} + \epsilon_2 \hat n_2 + \epsilon_1}}}\\
&= \wl{H}^D_0 + \epsilon_2 + |V_1|^2\rr{\hat n_1 - \hat n_{d\sigma_1}} \qq{\fr{1}{ \omega - \rr{\epsilon_d \sum\hat n_{d\sigma} + \epsilon_1}} + \fr{1}{ \omega - \rr{\epsilon_{d} \sum \hat n_{d\sigma} + \epsilon_2 + \epsilon_1}}}\\
&= \wl{H}^D_0 + \epsilon_2 + \rr{\hat n_1 - \hat n_{d\sigma_1}} A(\omega)
\eeq
Now the individual terms can be calculated:
\beq
\hf\text{Tr}_{2}\ham_1 &= \wl{H_0} + \hf\epsilon_2 + \hf|V_1|^2\tau_1\text{Tr}_{2}\cc{c_1^\dagger c_{d\sigma_1}, c^\dagger_{d\sigma_1}c_1 \fr{1}{\hat \omega - \rr{\ham_0^D + \epsilon_2 \hat n_2  + \epsilon_1}\hat n_1}}\\

\eeq
The \il{\fr{3}{2}} term comes from the \il{\tau_1} part in \il{\ol H_0} and then putting \il{\tau_1 = 1}. 
To simplify these terms, we will put \il{\hat n_1 = \hat n_2 = 1}. Then,
\beq
				    &\rr{\hat n_1 - \hat n_{d\sigma_1}} A(\omega) = \rr{1 - \hat n_{d\sigma_1}} A(\omega)\\
					     &= \rr{1 - \hat n_{d\sigma_1}}\qq{\fr{1}{ \omega - \rr{\epsilon_d \hat n_{d\ol\sigma_1} + \epsilon_1}} + \fr{1}{ \omega - \rr{\epsilon_{d}\hat n_{d\ol\sigma_1} + \epsilon_2 + \epsilon_1}}}\\
					     &= \rr{1 - \hat n_{d\sigma_1}}\epsilon_2 \hat n_{d\ol\sigma_1}\left[\fr{1}{\rr{\omega -\epsilon_1 - \epsilon_2}\rr{\omega -\epsilon_1}} - \fr{1}{\rr{\omega -\epsilon_1 - \epsilon_d}\rr{\omega -\epsilon_1 - \epsilon_2 - \epsilon_d}}\right]
\eeq
I dropped a constant term at the last step.
\beq
\rr{\hat n_1 - \hat n_{d\sigma_1}} A(\omega) =  A_1(\omega) \hat n_{d\ol\sigma_1} + A_2(\omega)\hat n_{d\ua}\hat n_{d\da}

Eq.~\ref{thirdterm} becomes

\eeq
For a better view, we can compute this Hamiltonian for the model eq.~\ref{andersonmodel}.
\beq
\hf\text{Tr}_{1}\ham &= H_0 + H_2 + H_3 + \hf\epsilon_1\\
\tau_1\text{Tr}_1\rr{\ham \tau_1} &= \hf\epsilon_1\tau_1\\
\tau_{1}\cc{c^\dagger_{1}\text{Tr}_{1}\rr{\ham c_{1}},\eta_{1}} &= \tau_1 |V_1|^2\cc{c_1^\dagger c_{d\sigma_1}, c^\dagger_{d\sigma_1}c_1 \fr{1}{\hat \omega - \rr{\ham_0^D + \epsilon_2 \hat n_2 +\epsilon_3 \hat n_3 + \epsilon_1}\hat n_1}}
\eeq
Therefore, dropping the constant \il{\hf\epsilon_1},
\beq[ham22]
\ham_1 &= H_0 + H_2 + H_3 + \hf\tau_1\epsilon_1 + |V_1|^2\tau_1 \cc{c_1^\dagger c_{d\sigma_1}, c^\dagger_{d\sigma_1}c_1 \fr{1}{\hat \omega - \rr{\ham_0^D + \epsilon_2 \hat n_2 + \epsilon_3 \hat n_3 +\epsilon_1}\hat n_1}}\\
       &= H_0 + H_2 + H_3 + \hf\tau_1\epsilon_1 + |V_1|^2\tau_1 \cc{c_1^\dagger c_{d\sigma_1}, c^\dagger_{d\sigma_1}c_1 \fr{1}{\hat \omega - \rr{\epsilon_d\sum_\sigma\hat n_{d\sigma} + \epsilon_2 \hat n_2 + \epsilon_3 \hat n_3 +\epsilon_1}\hat n_1}}\\
       &= H_0 + H_2 + H_3 + \hf\tau_1\epsilon_1 + |V_1|^2\tau_1 \cc{c_1^\dagger c_{d\sigma_1}, c^\dagger_{d\sigma_1}c_1 \fr{2}{\omega - \rr{\epsilon_d\sum_\sigma\hat n_{d\sigma} + \epsilon_2 \hat n_2 + \epsilon_3 \hat n_3 +\epsilon_1}}}\\
       &= H_0 + H_2 + H_3 + \hf\tau_1\epsilon_1 + |V_1|^2 2\tau_1 \cc{c_1^\dagger c_{d\sigma_1}, c^\dagger_{d\sigma_1}c_1 \fr{1}{\omega - \rr{\epsilon_d\hat n_{d\ol\sigma_1} + \epsilon_2 \hat n_2 + \epsilon_3 \hat n_3 +\epsilon_1}}}\\

       &= H_0 + H_2 + H_3 + \hf\tau_1\epsilon_1 + |V_1|^2 \fr{1}{\omega - \rr{\epsilon_d\hat n_{d\ol\sigma_1} + \epsilon_2 \hat n_2 + \epsilon_3 \hat n_3 +\epsilon_1}}\rr{\hat n_1 - \hat n_{d\sigma_1}}
\eeq
The next rotated Hamiltonian is
\beq
\ham_{2}&=\hf\text{Tr}_{2}\ham_{1} + \tau_2\text{Tr}_2\rr{\ham_{1} \tau_2} + \tau_{2}\cc{c^\dagger_{2}\text{Tr}_{2}\rr{\ham_{1} c_{2}},\eta_{2}}
\eeq
This can be evaluated by substituting eq.~\ref{ham22} into this expression.
For convenience later, I first compute a specific quantity:
\beq
\ham_1^D &= H_0^D + \epsilon_2 \hat n_2 + \epsilon_3 \hat n_3 + \hf\epsilon_1 \tau_1 + |V_1|^2 \fr{1}{\omega - \rr{\epsilon_d\hat n_{d\ol\sigma_1} + \epsilon_2 \hat n_2 + \epsilon_3 \hat n_3 +\epsilon_1}}\rr{\hat n_1 - \hat n_{d\sigma_1}}\\
\text{Tr}_2\rr{\ham_1^D \hat n_2} &= {H}^D_0 + \hf\epsilon_1 \tau_1 + \epsilon_3 \hat n_3+ \epsilon_2 \\
				  &+ |V_1|^2 \rr{\hat n_1 - \hat n_{d\sigma_1}}\text{Tr}_2\qq{\fr{1}{\omega - \rr{\epsilon_d\hat n_{d\ol\sigma_1} + \epsilon_2 \hat n_2 + \epsilon_3 \hat n_3 +\epsilon_1}}\hat n_2}\\
&= {H}^D_0 + \hf\epsilon_1 \tau_1 + \epsilon_3 \hat n_3+ \epsilon_2 + |V_1|^2 \rr{\hat n_1 - \hat n_{d\sigma_1}}\fr{1}{\omega - \rr{\epsilon_d\hat n_{d\ol\sigma_1} + \epsilon_2 + \epsilon_3 \hat n_3 +\epsilon_1}}\\
&= {H}^D_0 + \hf\epsilon_1 \tau_1 + \epsilon_3 \hat n_3+ \epsilon_2 + |V_1|^2 \rr{\hat n_1 - \hat n_{d\sigma_1}}A(\omega,\epsilon_2)
\eeq
where \il{A(\omega,\epsilon_2) \equiv |V_1|^2\fr{1}{\omega - \rr{\epsilon_d\hat n_{d\ol\sigma_1} + \epsilon_2 + \epsilon_3 \hat n_3 +\epsilon_1}}}.
Now the individual terms can be calculated:
\beq
\hf\text{Tr}_{2}\ham_1 &= H_0 + H_3 + \hf\tau_1\epsilon_1 + \hf\epsilon_2 + |V_1|^2 \rr{\hat n_1 - \hat n_{d\sigma_1}}\text{Tr}_2\qq{\fr{1}{\omega - \rr{\epsilon_d\hat n_{d\ol\sigma_1} + \epsilon_2 \hat n_2 + \epsilon_3 \hat n_3 +\epsilon_1}}}\\
		       &= H_0 + H_3 + \hf\tau_1\epsilon_1 + |V_1|^2 \rr{\hat n_1 - \hat n_{d\sigma_1}}\qq{A(\omega,\epsilon_2) + A(\omega,0)}
\eeq
\beq
\tau_2\text{Tr}_2\rr{\ham_1 \tau_2} &= \tau_2\text{Tr}_2\rr{\epsilon_2 \hat n_2 \tau_2 + |V_1|^2 \rr{\hat n_1 - \hat n_{d\sigma_1}}\qq{\fr{1}{\omega - \rr{\epsilon_d\hat n_{d\ol\sigma_1} + \epsilon_2 \hat n_2 + \epsilon_3 \hat n_3 +\epsilon_1}}}\tau_2}\\
				    &= \hf\epsilon_2\tau_2 + |V_1|^2 \rr{\hat n_1 - \hat n_{d\sigma_1}}\tau_2 \text{Tr}_2\qq{\fr{1}{\omega - \rr{\epsilon_d\hat n_{d\ol\sigma_1} + \epsilon_2 \hat n_2 + \epsilon_3 \hat n_3 +\epsilon_1}}\tau_2}\\
				    &= \hf\epsilon_2\tau_2 +  \hf|V_1|^2\rr{\hat n_1 - \hat n_{d\sigma_1}}\tau_2\qq{A(\omega,\epsilon_2) - A(\omega,0)}\\
\eeq
\beq
				    &\tau_{2}\cc{c^\dagger_{2}\text{Tr}_{2}\rr{\ham_{1} c_{2}},\eta_{2}}\\
				    &= \tau_2 |V_2|^2\cc{c^\dagger_2 c_{d\sigma_2},c^\dagger_{d\sigma_2}c_2\fr{1}{\hat \omega^\prime - \qq{{H}^D_0 + \hf\epsilon_1 \tau_1 + \epsilon_3 \hat n_3+ \epsilon_2 + |V_1|^2\rr{\hat n_1 - \hat n_{d\sigma_1}} A_2(\omega,\epsilon_2)}\hat n_2}}\\
				    &= \tau_2 |V_2|^2\cc{c^\dagger_2 c_{d\sigma_2},c^\dagger_{d\sigma_2}c_2\fr{1}{\hat \omega^\prime - \qq{\epsilon_d\sum_\sigma \hat n_{d\sigma} + \hf\epsilon_1 \tau_1 + \epsilon_3 \hat n_3+ \epsilon_2}\hat n_2}}
\eeq
In the last step I absorbed the kinetic energy of the lower shells as well as dropped the \il{A_2(\omega)} because we are ignoring the renormalization of the \il{\omega} by the previous \il{\omega} on the same shell.
\beq
				    &\tau_{2}\cc{c^\dagger_{2}\text{Tr}_{2}\rr{\ham_{1} c_{2}},\eta_{2}}\\
				    &= \tau_2 |V_2|^2\cc{c^\dagger_2 c_{d\sigma_2},c^\dagger_{d\sigma_2}c_2\fr{1}{\hat \omega^\prime - \qq{\epsilon_d\sum_\sigma \hat n_{d\sigma} + \hf\epsilon_1 \tau_1 + \epsilon_3 \hat n_3+ \epsilon_2}\hat n_2}}\\
				    &= \tau_2 |V_2|^2\cc{c^\dagger_2 c_{d\sigma_2},c^\dagger_{d\sigma_2}c_2\fr{1}{\hat \omega^\prime - \qq{\epsilon_d \hat n_{d\ol\sigma_2} + \hf\epsilon_1 \tau_1 + \epsilon_3 \hat n_3+ \epsilon_2}\hat n_2}}\\
				    &= 2\tau_2 |V_2|^2\cc{c^\dagger_2 c_{d\sigma_2},c^\dagger_{d\sigma_2}c_2}\fr{1}{\omega^\prime - \qq{\epsilon_d\hat n_{d\ol\sigma_2} + \hf\epsilon_1 \tau_1 + \epsilon_3 \hat n_3+ \epsilon_2}}\\

								    &= |V_2|^2\qq{\hat n_2 - \hat n_{d\sigma_2}}\fr{1}{\omega^\prime - \qq{\epsilon_d\hat n_{d\ol\sigma_2} + \hf\epsilon_1 \tau_1 + \epsilon_3 \hat n_3+ \epsilon_2}}\label{thirdterm}
\eeq
\comm{
To simplify these terms, we will put \il{\hat n_1 = \hat n_2 = 1}. Then,
\beq
				    &\rr{\hat n_1 - \hat n_{d\sigma_1}} A(\omega) = \rr{1 - \hat n_{d\sigma_1}} A(\omega)\\
					     &= \rr{1 - \hat n_{d\sigma_1}}\qq{\fr{1}{ \omega - \rr{\epsilon_d \hat n_{d\ol\sigma_1} + \epsilon_1}} + \fr{1}{ \omega - \rr{\epsilon_{d}\hat n_{d\ol\sigma_1} + \epsilon_2 + \epsilon_1}}}\\

\eeq
I dropped a constant term at the last step.
\beq
\rr{\hat n_1 - \hat n_{d\sigma_1}} A(\omega) =  A_1(\omega) \hat n_{d\ol\sigma_1} + A_2(\omega)\hat n_{d\ua}\hat n_{d\da}
\eeq
Eq.~\ref{thirdterm} becomes
\beq
					     &|V_2|^2\qq{1 - \hat n_{d\sigma_2}}\fr{1}{\omega^\prime - \qq{\epsilon_d \hat n_{d\ol\sigma_2} + \fr{3}{2}\epsilon_1 + \epsilon_2 + A(\omega)\rr{\hat n_1 - \hat n_{d\sigma_1}}}}\\

					     &=
				     \eeq}
				     The total second step Hamiltonian is (dropping a constant term)
\beq
	\ham_2 &= H_0 + H_3 + \hf\tau_1\epsilon_1 +  |V_1|^2 \rr{\hat n_1 - \hat n_{d\sigma_1}}\qq{A(\omega,\epsilon_2) + A(\omega,0)} + \hf\epsilon_2\tau_2 \\

\eeq
To get the next step Hamiltonian, we again compute the same terms, but now with this Hamiltonian.
\beq

\eeq
Note that this term will go in the denominator of \il{\eta_3} and hence will renormalize the next quantum fluctuation operator, \il{\omega^{\prime\prime}}.
Since we are ignoring the renormalization of \il{\omega^{\prime\prime}} by its previous counterparts on the same shell, we can drop the terms containing \il{\omega} and \il{\omega^\prime} in this term:
\beq
\text{Tr}_3\rr{\ham_2^D \hat n_3} = H_0^D + \epsilon_3 + \hf\rr{\tau_1\epsilon_1 + \epsilon_2\tau_2}

\eeq
Define
\begin{gather}
H_0 \equiv \sum_{k<\Lambda_N\atop{\sigma}}\qq{\epsilon_k \hat n_{k\sigma} +  V_{k} c^\dagger_{k\sigma} c_{d\sigma} + \text{h.c.}} +  \sum_{k_,k^\prime,q\atop{\sigma\sigma^\prime}} v_q c^\dagger_{k+q,\sigma}c^\dagger_{k^\prime-q,\sigma^\prime}c_{k,\sigma}c_{k^\prime,\sigma^\prime}\\
H_\text{imp} =\epsilon_{d}\sum_\sigma  \hat n_{d\sigma} +  U \hat n_{d\ua} \hat n_{d\da}
\end{gather}
Then,
\beq
\ham_1 &= \hf\text{Tr}_\text{all}\rr{\ham} + \sum_{q\beta}\tau_{q\beta} \cc{c^\dagger_{q\beta}\text{Tr}_{q\beta}\rr{\ham c_{q\beta}},\eta_{q\beta}}\\
\eeq
The first term is
\beq
\hf\text{Tr}_\text{all}\rr{\ham} = H_0 + H_\text{imp} + \hf\sum_{q\beta}\qq{\epsilon_q + \sum_{k<\Lambda_N,\sigma}v_{k-q}\hat n_{k\sigma}} 
\eeq
The second term is:
\beq
c^\dagger_{q\beta}\text{Tr}_{q\beta}\rr{\ham c_{q\beta}} &= V_q c^\dagger_{q\beta}c_{d\beta} + \sum_{k,p}v^*_p c^\dagger_{q\beta}c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c_{k+p,\sigma}c_{q-p,\beta}\\
							 &= c^\dagger_{q\beta}\rr{V_q c_{d\beta} + \sum_{k,p}v^*_p c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c_{k+p,\sigma}c_{q-p,\beta}}

\beq

	      &=\qq{ \rr{V^*_q c^\dagger_{d\beta} + \sum_{k,p}v_p c^\dagger_{q-p,\beta}c^\dagger_{k+p,\sigma}c_{k\sigma}}c_{q\beta}}\fr{2}{\omega - \qq{\epsilon_d \hat n_{d\ol\beta} + \epsilon_q}}\\
\eeq
\beq
	      \sum_{q\beta}\tau_{q\beta} \cc{c^\dagger_{q\beta}\text{Tr}_{q\beta}\rr{\ham c_{q\beta}},\eta_{q\beta}} =
	      \sum_{q\beta}\fr{2\tau_{q\beta}}{\omega - \qq{\epsilon_d \hat n_{d\ol\beta} + \epsilon_q}} \left\{c^\dagger_{q\beta}\rr{V_q c_{d\beta} + \sum_{k,p}v^*_p c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c_{k+p,\sigma}c_{q-p,\beta}}\right.,\\
	      \quad\left.\rr{V^*_q c^\dagger_{d\beta} + \sum_{k,p}v_p c^\dagger_{q-p,\beta}c^\dagger_{k+p,\sigma}c_{k\sigma}}c_{q\beta}\right\}
\eeq
Because \il{2\tau_{q\beta}c_{q\beta} = -c_{q\beta}} and \il{2\tau_{q\beta}c^\dagger_{q\beta} = c^\dagger_{q\beta}}, we get
\beq
	      \sum_{q\beta}\fr{1}{\omega - \qq{\epsilon_d \hat n_{d\ol\beta} + \epsilon_q}} \left[c^\dagger_{q\beta}\rr{V_q c_{d\beta} + \sum_{k,p}v^*_p c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c_{k+p,\sigma}c_{q-p,\beta}}\right.,\\
	      \quad\left.\rr{V^*_q c^\dagger_{d\beta} + \sum_{k,p}v_p c^\dagger_{q-p,\beta}c^\dagger_{k+p,\sigma}c_{k\sigma}}c_{q\beta}\right]
\eeq
The first commutator renormalizes the impurity site energy:
\beq
\qq{V_q c^\dagger_{q\beta} c_{d\beta}, V_q^* c^\dagger_{d\beta} c_{q\beta}} = |V_q|^2 \rr{\hat n_{q\beta} - \hat n_{d\beta}}
\eeq
The second  term gives:
\beq
\qq{V_q c^\dagger_{q\beta}c_{d\beta}, \sum_{k,p,\sigma}v_p c^\dagger_{q-p,\beta}c^\dagger_{k+p,\sigma}c_{k\sigma}c_{q\beta}} &= \sum_{k,p,\sigma}V_q v_p \qq{c^\dagger_{q\beta}c_{d\beta},c^\dagger_{q-p,\beta}c^\dagger_{k+p,\sigma}c_{k,\sigma}c_{q,\beta}}\\
&=-\sum_{k,p,\sigma}V_q v_p c_{d\beta}c^\dagger_{k+p,\sigma}c^\dagger_{q-p,\beta}c_{k,\sigma}\\
															     &=-\sum_{k,p,\sigma}V_q v_p c_{d\beta}c^\dagger_{k+p,\sigma}\rr{ \delta_{q=k+p\atop{\beta=\sigma}} - c_{k,\sigma}c^\dagger_{q-p,\beta}}\\
&=\sum_{k,p,\sigma}V_q v_p c_{d\beta}c^\dagger_{k+p,\sigma}c_{k,\sigma}c^\dagger_{q-p,\beta}
\eeq
In the second step, I chose the \il{\hat n_{q\beta}= 1} sector.
In the last step I used the fact that since the only electron on the shell is the one with \il{q}, we must have \il{k+p \neq q}, hence the \il{\delta_{q=k+p}} gives zero.
The third term is just the Hermitian conjugate:
\beq
\qq{\sum_{k,p,\sigma}v_p^* c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c^\dagger_{q\beta}c_{k+p,\sigma}c_{q-p,\beta},V^*_q c^\dagger_{d\beta} c_{q\beta}} &=\sum_{k,p,\sigma}V^*_q v^*_p c_{q-p,\beta}c^\dagger_{k,\sigma}c_{k+p,\sigma}c^\dagger_{d,\beta}
\eeq
The fourth term gives (using \il{\hat n_{q\beta} = 1}),
\beq
\qq{\sum_{k,p,\sigma}v_p^* c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c^\dagger_{q\beta}c_{k+p,\sigma}c_{q-p,\beta},\sum_{k^\prime,p^\prime,\sigma^\prime}v_p^\prime c^\dagger_{q-p^\prime,\beta}c^\dagger_{k^\prime+p^\prime,\sigma^\prime}c_{k^\prime\sigma^\prime}c_{q\beta}} \\
=\sum v_p^* v_{p^\prime} &c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c_{k+p,\sigma}c_{q-p,\beta}c^\dagger_{q-p^\prime,\beta}c^\dagger_{k^\prime+p^\prime,\sigma^\prime}c_{k^\prime\sigma^\prime}
\eeq
The total renormalization is thus
\beq
\Delta H = \sum_{q\beta}\fr{1}{\omega - \qq{\epsilon_d \hat n_{d\ol\beta} + \epsilon_q}} \left[|V_q|^2 \rr{\hat n_{q\beta} - \hat n_{d\beta}} + \sum_{k,p,\sigma}V_q v_p c_{d\beta}c^\dagger_{k+p,\sigma}c_{k,\sigma}c^\dagger_{q-p,\beta} + \text{h.c.} \right.\\
	 \quad\quad+\left.\sum v_p^* v_{p^\prime} c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c_{k+p,\sigma}c_{q-p,\beta}c^\dagger_{q-p^\prime,\beta}c^\dagger_{k^\prime+p^\prime,\sigma^\prime}c_{k^\prime\sigma^\prime}\right]\\

The first of the two terms renormalizes the coupling \il{V_k}.
The third term is the Hermitian conjugate of this term.
The fourth term produces a potential scattering term.

\sum_{q\beta}|V_q|^2\rr{1 - \hat n_{d\beta}}\fr{1}{\omega - \rr{H_\text{imp} + V_2 \hat n_{d\beta} + \epsilon_q}} = \sum_{q\beta}|V_q|^2\fr{\hat n_{d\beta}\rr{\epsilon_q - \omega + 2\epsilon_{d}} - \hat n_{d\ua}\hat n_{d\da}\epsilon_{d}}{\rr{\omega - \epsilon_q}\rr{\omega - \epsilon_q - \epsilon_{d}}}
\eeq
Just as in the previous section, they renormalize the onsite energy \il{\epsilon_d} and double-occupation penalty \il{U}.
The third term in \il{\Delta \ham_N} gives 
\beq
	      &-\sum_{k\sigma q \beta}c_{k\sigma}c^\dagger_{d\sigma} V^*_q V_2 \rr{1 - \hat n_{d\beta}}\fr{1}{\omega - \rr{H_\text{imp} + V_2 \hat n_{d\beta} + \epsilon_q}} \\
	      &= -\sum_{k\sigma q}c_{k\sigma}c^\dagger_{d\sigma} V^*_q V_2 \qq{\fr{2}{\omega - \epsilon_q} + \fr{\sum_\beta\hat n_{d\beta}\rr{\epsilon_q - \omega + 2\epsilon_{d}}}{\rr{\omega - \epsilon_q}\rr{\omega - \epsilon_q - \epsilon_{d}}} -  \fr{2\hat n_{d\ua}\hat n_{d\da}\epsilon_{d}}{\rr{\omega - \epsilon_q}\rr{\omega -\epsilon_q - \epsilon_{d}}}}\\
	      &= -\sum_{k\sigma q}c_{k\sigma}c^\dagger_{d\sigma} V^*_q V_2 \qq{\fr{2}{\omega - \epsilon_q} + \fr{\hat n_{d\ol\sigma}\rr{\epsilon_q - \omega + 2\epsilon_{d}}}{\rr{\omega - \epsilon_q}\rr{\omega - \epsilon_q - \epsilon_{d}}}}\\
	      &= \sum_{k\sigma q}c^\dagger_{d\sigma} c_{k\sigma}V^*_q V_2 \qq{\fr{2}{\omega - \epsilon_q} + \fr{\hat n_{d\ol\sigma}\rr{\epsilon_q - \omega + 2\epsilon_{d}}}{\rr{\omega - \epsilon_q}\rr{\omega - \epsilon_q - \epsilon_{d}}}}
\eeq
In the penultimate step, I used
\beq
c^\dagger_{d\sigma}\times\sum_\beta\hat n_{d\beta} = c^\dagger_{d\sigma}\times\rr{\hat n_{d\sigma} + \hat n_{d\ol\sigma}} = c^\dagger_{d\sigma} \hat n_{d\ol\sigma}
\eeq
and
\beq
c^\dagger_{d\sigma}\times\hat n_{d\ua}\hat n_{d\da} = c^\dagger_{d\sigma}\times\hat n_{d\sigma}\hat n_{d\ol\sigma} = 0
\eeq
The first of these terms renormalizes the coupling \il{V^*_{k^\prime}}.
The second term in \il{\Delta \ham_N} gives
\beq
	      &-\sum_{q\beta k\sigma} V_q V_2 \rr{1-\hat n_{d\beta}}c_{d\sigma}c^\dagger_{k\sigma} \fr{1}{\omega - \rr{H_\text{imp} + V_2 \hat n_{d\beta} + \epsilon_q}}\\
	      &=-\sum_{q k\sigma} V_q V_2 c_{d\sigma}c^\dagger_{k\sigma} \qq{\fr{1}{\omega - \rr{H_\text{imp} + V_2 \hat n_{d\sigma} + \epsilon_q}} + \rr{1 -\hat n_{d\ol\sigma}}\fr{1}{\omega - \rr{H_\text{imp} + \epsilon_q}}}\\
	      &=-\sum_{q k\sigma} V_q V_2 c_{d\sigma}c^\dagger_{k\sigma} \left[\fr{2\rr{\omega - \epsilon_q - \epsilon_d} - V_2}{\rr{\omega - \epsilon_d - \epsilon_q}\rr{\omega - \epsilon_d - \epsilon_q - V_2}} \right.\\
	      &\quad\left.+ \quad\hat n_{d\ol\sigma}\cc{\fr{\epsilon_d + U}{\rr{\omega - 2\epsilon_d - U - \epsilon_q - V_2}\rr{\omega - \epsilon_d - \epsilon_q - V_2}} - \fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q  -\epsilon_d}}\right]\\
	      &=\sum_{q k\sigma} V_q V_2 c^\dagger_{k\sigma} c_{d\sigma}\left[\fr{2\rr{\omega - \epsilon_q - \epsilon_d} - V_2}{\rr{\omega - \epsilon_d - \epsilon_q}\rr{\omega - \epsilon_d - \epsilon_q - V_2}} \right.\\

\eeq
The first of these terms renormalizes the coupling \il{V_{k^\prime}}.
The fourth term gives
\beq
	      &\sum_{kk^\prime q\beta\sigma\sigma^\prime}V^2_2 c_{k\sigma}c^\dagger_{d\sigma}\rr{1-\hat n_{d\beta}}c_{d\sigma^\prime}c^\dagger_{k^\prime\sigma^\prime}\fr{1}{\omega - \rr{H_\text{imp} + \epsilon_q}}\\

\eeq
The first line in the final equation describes the renormalization of \il{\epsilon_d} and \il{U} at order \il{V_2^2}.
The first term in the second line of the last equation describes the renormalization of the two-particle interaction coupling, \il{V_2}.

\eeq
Here I replaced \il{\hat \omega - \fr{\epsilon_q}{2} - \fr{H_{imp} + V_2 \hat n_{d\beta}}{2}} with \il{\hat \omega}, just as in the previous section, and then set \il{\hat n_{q\beta} = 0, \tau_{q\beta} = -\hf}.
Now,
\beq
\fr{1}{\omega + H_{imp} + V_2\hat n_{d\beta} + \epsilon_q } c^\dagger_{d\beta} &= \fr{1}{\omega + \epsilon_{d} + V_2 + \rr{\epsilon_d + U}\hat n_{d\ol\beta} + \epsilon_q } c^\dagger_{d\beta}\\

\eeq
The first term in \il{\Delta \ham_N} gives
\beq

\eeq
The second term gives

The first term on the RHS is zero, because it has two consecutive \il{c^\dagger_{d\sigma}}.
\beq

\eeq
The changes in the couplings are

\Delta \epsilon_d &= \sum_{q} \fr{|V_q|^2}{\omega + \epsilon_d + V_2 + \epsilon_q}\\
\Delta U &= \sum_{q}\fr{2|V_q|^2\rr{\epsilon_d + U}}{\rr{\omega + 2\epsilon_d + U + V_2 + \epsilon_q}\rr{\omega + \epsilon_d + V_2 + \epsilon_q}}\\
\Delta V_k &= \Delta V_k^* = 0\\
\Delta V_2 &= -\sum_{q}\fr{V_2^2}{\omega + \epsilon_d + V_2 + \epsilon_q}

\subsection*{With higher order scattering}
\beq
\ham = \sum_{k\sigma}\epsilon_k \hat n_{k\sigma} + \sum_{k\sigma} \rr{V_{k} c^\dagger_{k\sigma} c_{d\sigma} + h.c.} + \epsilon_{d}\sum_\sigma  \hat n_{d\sigma} +  U \hat n_{d\ua} \hat n_{d\da} + \sum_{kk^\prime\atop{\sigma\sigma^\prime}}V_2c^\dagger_{d\sigma^\prime}c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c_{d\sigma}c_{k^\prime\sigma^\prime}

Such an interaction allows both spin-flip (\il{d\sigma \to d\ol\sigma}) as well as spin-preserving (\il{d\sigma \to d\sigma}) scattering.
\paragraph{One electron on shell:}

The only operators acting on the shell electron can be pushed to the end, and we will get \il{\tau_{q\beta}\hat n_{q\beta} = \hf \hat n_{q\beta}}.
We can also simplify the last factor as
\beq

The first term in \il{\Delta \ham_N} is (calculated in the previous section)
\beq

\eeq
In the penultimate step, I used
\beq
c^\dagger_{d\sigma}\times\sum_\beta\hat n_{d\beta} = c^\dagger_{d\sigma}\times\rr{\hat n_{d\sigma} + \hat n_{d\ol\sigma}} = c^\dagger_{d\sigma} \hat n_{d\ol\sigma}
\eeq
and
\beq
c^\dagger_{d\sigma}\times\hat n_{d\ua}\hat n_{d\da} = c^\dagger_{d\sigma}\times\hat n_{d\sigma}\hat n_{d\ol\sigma} = 0
\eeq
The first of these terms renormalizes the coupling \il{V^*_{k^\prime}}.
The second term in \il{\Delta \ham_N} gives
\beq
	      &-\sum_{q\beta k\sigma} V_q V_2 \rr{1-\hat n_{d\beta}}c_{d\sigma}c^\dagger_{k\sigma} \fr{1/2}{\omega - \rr{H_\text{imp} + V_2 \hat n_{d\beta} + \epsilon_q}}\\

	      &=-\hf\sum_{q k\sigma} V_q V_2 c_{d\sigma}c^\dagger_{k\sigma} \left[\fr{2\rr{\omega - \epsilon_q - \epsilon_d} - V_2}{\rr{\omega - \epsilon_d - \epsilon_q}\rr{\omega - \epsilon_d - \epsilon_q - V_2}} \right.\\

\eeq
The first of these terms renormalizes the coupling \il{V_{k^\prime}}.
The fourth term gives

\eeq
The first line in the final equation describes the renormalization of \il{\epsilon_d} and \il{U} at order \il{V_2^2}.
The first term in the second line of the last equation describes the renormalization of the two-particle interaction coupling, \il{V_2}.

To get the hole kinetic energy, we write the kinetic energy part as

and drop the extra constant term.

\eeq
Here I set \il{\hat n_{q\beta} = 0, \tau_{q\beta} = -\hf}.
Now,
\beq
\fr{1/2}{\omega + H_{imp} - \epsilon_q } c^\dagger_{d\beta} &= \fr{1/2}{\omega + \epsilon_{d} + \rr{\epsilon_d + U}\hat n_{d\ol\beta} - \epsilon_q } c^\dagger_{d\beta}\\

\eeq
The first term in \il{\Delta \ham_N} gives
\beq

\eeq
The second term gives

The first term on the RHS is zero, because it has two consecutive \il{c^\dagger_{d\sigma}}.

\subsection*{With higher order scattering}
\beq
\ham = \sum_{k\sigma}\epsilon_k \hat n_{k\sigma} + \sum_{k\sigma} \rr{V_{k} c^\dagger_{k\sigma} c_{d\sigma} + h.c.} + \epsilon_{d}\sum_\sigma  \hat n_{d\sigma} +  U \hat n_{d\ua} \hat n_{d\da} + \sum_{kk^\prime\atop{\sigma\sigma^\prime}}V_2c^\dagger_{d\sigma^\prime}c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c_{d\sigma}c_{k^\prime\sigma^\prime}

Such an interaction allows both spin-flip (\il{d\sigma \to d\ol\sigma}) as well as spin-preserving (\il{d\sigma \to d\sigma}) scattering.
\paragraph{One electron on shell:}
\beq
\ham_N = H_0 + H_\text{imp} + \epsilon_q \hat n_{q\beta} + V_q c^\dagger_{q\beta}c_{d\beta} + V^*_q c^\dagger_{d\beta}c_{q\beta} + \sum_{k\sigma}V_2\rr{c^\dagger_{q\beta}c^\dagger_{d\sigma}c_{k\sigma}c_{d\beta} + c^\dagger_{d\beta}c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c_{d\sigma}c_{q\beta}}\\
+V_2 \hat n_{q\beta}\hat n_{d\beta}

\paragraph{Particle sector:}
The intermediate state consists of particle states, obtained by exciting electrons to the upper bandwidth edge (\il{+D}).
\beq
\Delta \ham_N &= \sum_{q\beta}\tau_{q\beta}c^\dagger_{d\beta}\qq{V^*_q + \sum_{k^\prime\sigma^\prime} V_2 c^\dagger_{k^\prime\sigma^\prime}c_{d\sigma^\prime}}c_{q\beta} \times\fr{1}{\hat \omega - \rr{H_\text{imp} + V_2 \hat n_{d\beta} + \epsilon_q}\hat n_{q\beta}}\\
	      &\times c^\dagger_{q\beta}\qq{V_q + \sum_{k\sigma}V_2 c^\dagger_{d\sigma}c_{k\sigma}}c_{d\beta}
\eeq
Since the Greens function is preceded by \il{c_{q\beta}}, we can substitute \il{\hat n_{q\beta}=1} in the denominator.
\beq
c_{q\beta} \times\fr{1}{\hat \omega - \rr{H_\text{imp} + V_2 \hat n_{d\beta} + \epsilon_q}\hat n_{q\beta}} &= c_{q\beta} \times\fr{1}{\hat \omega - \rr{H_\text{imp} + V_2 \hat n_{d\beta} + \epsilon_q}}\\
													   &= c_{q\beta} \times\fr{1}{\hat \omega - \fr{\epsilon_q}{2} - \rr{H_\text{imp} + V_2 \hat n_{d\beta} + \fr{\epsilon_q}{2}}}
\eeq
Set \il{\hat \omega - \fr{\epsilon_q}{2} = 2\omega \tau_{q\beta} = \omega}.
\beq
c_{q\beta} \times\fr{1}{\omega - \rr{H_\text{imp} + V_2 \hat n_{d\beta} + \fr{\epsilon_q}{2}}}

Since \il{\tau_{q\beta}c_{q\beta} = -\hf c_{q\beta}}, we get
\beq

\subsection{A more careful calculation with both channels affecting \il{\epsilon_d} and \il{U}:}

\subsubsection{Particle sector:}
The intermediate state consists of particle states, obtained by exciting electrons to the upper bandwidth edge (\il{+D}).
\beq
\Delta \ham_N &= \sum_{q\beta}\tau_{q\beta}c^\dagger_{d\beta}\qq{V^*_q + \sum_{k^\prime\sigma^\prime} V_2 c^\dagger_{k^\prime\sigma^\prime}c_{d\sigma^\prime}}c_{q\beta} \times\fr{1}{\hat \omega - \rr{H_\text{imp} + V_2 \hat n_{d\beta} + \epsilon_q}\hat n_{q\beta}}\\
	      &\times c^\dagger_{q\beta}\qq{V_q + \sum_{k\sigma}V_2 c^\dagger_{d\sigma}c_{k\sigma}}c_{d\beta}
\eeq
Since the Greens function is preceded by \il{c_{q\beta}}, we can substitute \il{\hat n_{q\beta}=1} in the denominator.
\beq
c_{q\beta} \times\fr{1}{\hat \omega - \rr{H_\text{imp} + V_2 \hat n_{d\beta} + \epsilon_q}\hat n_{q\beta}} &= c_{q\beta} \times\fr{1}{\hat \omega - \rr{H_\text{imp} + V_2 \hat n_{d\beta} + \epsilon_q}}\\
													   &= c_{q\beta} \times\fr{1}{\hat \omega - \fr{\epsilon_q}{2} - \rr{H_\text{imp} + V_2 \hat n_{d\beta} + \fr{\epsilon_q}{2}}}
\eeq
Set \il{\hat \omega - \fr{\epsilon_q}{2} = 2\omega \tau_{q\beta} = \omega}.
\beq
c_{q\beta} \times\fr{1}{\omega - \rr{H_\text{imp} + V_2 \hat n_{d\beta} + \fr{\epsilon_q}{2}}}

Since \il{\tau_{q\beta}c_{q\beta} = -\hf c_{q\beta}}, we get
\beq

\il{\epsilon_q^+} is the energy of a particle excitation in the momentum \il{q}.  \il{\ham_N^{D,1} \equiv \text{Tr}\rr{\ham_N \hat n_{q\beta}}\hat n_{q\beta}} is the diagonal part of \il{\ham_N} in the particle sector, \il{H_{N-1}^C} is the remaining conduction band part of the Hamiltonian and \il{H_{imp}} is the impurity-diagonal part (\il{\equiv \epsilon_{d}\sum_\sigma  \hat n_{d\sigma} +  U \hat n_{d\ua} \hat n_{d\da}}). Putting it all together,
\beq
\Delta^+ \ham_N = \sum_{q\beta}V_q^* c^\dagger_{d\beta}c_{q\beta}\fr{1}{\hat \omega - \qq{H_{N-1}^C + \epsilon_q^+ + H_{imp}}\hat n_{q\beta}}V_q c^\dagger_{q\beta}c_{d\beta}
\eeq
Since the internal propagator is preceded by a \il{c^\dagger_{q\beta}c_{d\beta}}, we can set \il{\hat n_{q\beta} =1} and \il{\hat n_{d\beta} = 0} inside the propagator. \il{H_{imp}} then becomes \il{\epsilon_d \hat n_{d\ol\beta}}.
\beq
\Delta^+ \ham_N = \sum_{q\beta}V_q^* c^\dagger_{d\beta}c_{q\beta}\fr{1}{\hat \omega - \qq{H_{N-1}^C + \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_{d}\hat n_{d\ol\beta}}} V_q c^\dagger_{q\beta}c_{d\beta}
\eeq
Since the propagator is devoid of any operator in \il{q\beta} or \il{d\beta} now, it can be pushed to the end:
\beq
\Delta^+ \ham_N &= \sum_{q\beta}|V_q|^2 c^\dagger_{d\beta}c_{q\beta}c^\dagger_{q\beta}c_{d\beta}\fr{1}{\hat \omega - \qq{H_{N-1}^C + \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_{d}\hat n_{d\ol\beta}}} \\
		&= \sum_{q\beta}|V_q|^2 \hat n_{d\beta}\rr{1 - \hat n_{q\beta}}\fr{1}{\hat \omega - \qq{H_{N-1}^C + \epsilon_{d}\hat n_{d\ol\beta}} - \epsilon_q^+} \\
\eeq
The \il{1 - \hat n_{q\beta}} ensures that the state we act on has no excited state \il{q\beta}, so it is a ground state. Similarly, the \il{\hat n_{d\beta}} ensures we need to have \il{\hat n_{d\beta} =1 } in that state. We now add and subtract a \il{\epsilon_d \hat n_{d\beta} + U\hat n_{d\beta} \hat n_{d\ol\beta} = \epsilon_d  + U \hat n_{d\ol\beta}} in the propagator:
\beq
\Delta^+ \ham_N	&= \sum_{q\beta}|V_q|^2 \hat n_{d\beta}\rr{1 - \hat n_{q\beta}}\fr{1}{\hat \omega - \qq{H_{N-1}^C + \epsilon_{d}\hat n_{d\ol\beta} + \epsilon_d \hat n_{d\beta} + U\hat n_{d\beta} \hat n_{d\ol\beta}} - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d + U \hat n_{d\ol\beta}}
\eeq
Note that 
\beq
H^G \equiv H_{N-1}^C + \epsilon_{d}\hat n_{d\ol\beta} + \epsilon_d \hat n_{d\beta} + U\hat n_{d\beta} \hat n_{d\ol\beta} = H_{N-1}^C + H_{imp
}
\eeq is the Hamiltonian consisting of the remaining conduction band electrons and the impurity, so it gives the energy of the ground state upon which we create the excitations to the band edges. 
\beq
\Delta^+ \ham_N	= \sum_{q\beta}|V_q|^2 \hat n_{d\beta}\rr{1 - \hat n_{q\beta}}\fr{1}{\hat \omega - H^G - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d  + U \hat n_{d\ol\beta}}
\eeq
\textit{If we measure the quantum fluctuation energy scale relative to the ground state energy \il{H^G}, we can set \il{H^G} to \il{0}.} A further simplification is made when we replace \il{\hat \omega} by its eigenvalue \il{\omega}:
\beq
\Delta^+ \ham_N	= \sum_{q\beta}|V_q|^2 \hat n_{d\beta}\rr{1 - \hat n_{q\beta}}\fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d + U \hat n_{d\ol\beta}}
\eeq
\textit{Assuming there are no excited states on the band edges to begin with}, we can set \il{\hat n_{q\beta} = 0}.
\beq
\Delta^+ \ham_N	= \sum_{q\beta}\hat n_{d\beta}|V_q|^2 \fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d + U \hat n_{d\ol\beta}}
\eeq
To lift the \il{\hat n_{d\ol\beta}} from the denominator into the numerator, we can expand the propagator in the basis of \il{\hat n_{d\ol\beta}}:
\beq[change]
\fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d  + U \hat n_{d\ol\beta}} &= \fr{\hat n_{d\ol\beta}}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d  + U } + \fr{1 - \hat n_{d\ol\beta}}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d}\\
								 &= \hat n_{d\ol\beta}\rr{\fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d  + U } - \fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d}} + \fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d}\\
\eeq
Substituting in \il{\Delta^+ \ham_N} gives
\beq
\Delta^+ \ham_N	&= \sum_{q\beta}|V_q|^2\hat n_{d\beta} \qq{\fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d} + \hat n_{d\ol\beta}\rr{\fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d + U} - \fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d}}}\\
		&= \sum_{\beta}\hat n_{d\beta}\sum_q |V_q|^2 \fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d} + \hat n_{d\ua}\hat n_{d\da} \sum_q 2|V_q|^2\rr{\fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d + U} - \fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d}} \\
\eeq
There I used \il{\sum_{\beta} \hat n_{d\beta} \hat n_{d\ol\beta} = 2\hat n_{d\ua}\hat n_{d\da}}. Comparing with the bare impurity Hamiltonian we get the following scaling equations for the particle sector:
\beq
\Delta^+ \epsilon_d &= \sum_q |V_q|^2 \fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d}\\
\Delta^+ U &= \sum_q 2|V_q|^2\rr{\fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d  + U } - \fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d}}
\eeq

\subsubsection*{Hole sector}
The excited states consist of holes on the lower band edge (\il{-D}).
\beq
\Delta^- \ham_N = \sum_{q\beta}c^\dagger_{q\beta}\text{Tr}\qq{\ham_N c_{q\beta}}\eta_{q\beta}
\eeq
where\footnote{all traces in this subsection are partial in \il{q\beta}} and 
\beq
\eta_{q\beta} = \fr{1}{\hat \omega - \ham_N^{D,0}}\text{Tr}\qq{c^\dagger_{q\beta} \ham_N} = V_q^* c^\dagger_{d\beta}c_{q\beta}\fr{1}{\hat \omega - \qq{H_{N-1}^{C} + H_{imp}}\rr{1 - \hat n_{q\beta}}}
\eeq
\il{\ham_N^{D,0} \equiv \text{Tr}\rr{\ham_N \rr{1 - \hat n_{q\beta}}}\rr{1 - \hat n_{q\beta}}} is the diagonal part of \il{\ham_N} in the hole sector, \il{H_{N-1}^C} is the remaining conduction band part of the Hamiltonian and \il{H_{imp}} is the impurity-diagonal part (\il{\equiv \epsilon_{d}\sum_\sigma  \hat n_{d\sigma} +  U \hat n_{d\ua} \hat n_{d\da}}). Putting it all together,
\beq
\Delta^- \ham_N = \sum_{q\beta}V_q c^\dagger_{q\beta}c_{d\beta}\fr{1}{\hat \omega - \qq{H_{N-1}^C + H_{imp}}\rr{1 - \hat n_{q\beta}}}V_q^* c^\dagger_{d\beta}c_{q\beta}
\eeq
Since the internal propagator is preceded by a \il{c^\dagger_{d\beta}c_{q\beta}}, we can set \il{\hat n_{q\beta} = 0} and \il{\hat n_{d\beta} = 1} inside the propagator. \il{H_{imp}} then becomes \il{\epsilon_d + \rr{\epsilon_d + U}\hat n_{d\ol\beta}}.
\beq
\Delta^- \ham_N = \sum_{q\beta}V_q c^\dagger_{q\beta}c_{d\beta}\fr{1}{\hat \omega - \qq{H_{N-1}^C + \epsilon_d + \rr{\epsilon_d + U}\hat n_{d\ol\beta}}} V_q^* c^\dagger_{d\beta}c_{q\beta}
\eeq
Since the propagator is devoid of any operator in \il{q\beta} or \il{d\beta} now, it can be pushed to the end:
\beq
\Delta^- \ham_N &= \sum_{q\beta}V_q c^\dagger_{q\beta}c_{d\beta} V_q^* c^\dagger_{d\beta}c_{q\beta}\fr{1}{\hat \omega - \qq{H_{N-1}^C + \epsilon_d + \rr{\epsilon_d + U}\hat n_{d\ol\beta}}}\\
		&= \sum_{q\beta}|V_q|^2 \hat n_{q\beta}\rr{1 - \hat n_{d\beta}} \fr{1}{\hat \omega - \qq{H_{N-1}^C + \epsilon_d \hat n_{d\ol\beta}} - \epsilon_d - U\hat n_{d\ol\beta}}
\eeq
The \il{\hat n_{q\beta}} ensures that the state we act on must have a state on the lower band edge at \il{-D}. Similarly, the \il{1 - \hat n_{d\beta}} ensures we need to have \il{\hat n_{d\beta} = 0} in that state. We can hence subtract a \il{\epsilon_d \hat n_{d\beta} + U\hat n_{d\beta} \hat n_{d\ol\beta} = 0} in the propagator:
\beq
\Delta^- \ham_N	&= \sum_{q\beta}|V_q|^2 \hat n_{q\beta}\rr{1 - \hat n_{d\beta}} \fr{1}{\hat \omega - \qq{H_{N-1}^C + \epsilon_d \hat n_{d\ol\beta} + \epsilon_d \hat n_{d\beta} + U\hat n_{d\beta} \hat n_{d\ol\beta}} - \epsilon_d - U\hat n_{d\ol\beta}}
\eeq
In order to convert the term in \il{\qq{\quad}} into the ground state energy \il{H^G}, we need to also add the energy of the state \il{-D} which is of course a part of the ground state (it is far inside the Fermi surface and hence most likely to be filled) but is not a part of \il{H^C_{N-1}} (because we are reducing the bandwidth and the state at \il{-D} has just gone out of the bandwidth). Adding and subtracting \il{\epsilon_q \hat n_{q\beta} = \epsilon_q^-} gives
\beq
\Delta^- \ham_N	&= \sum_{q\beta}|V_q|^2 \hat n_{q\beta}\rr{1 - \hat n_{d\beta}} \fr{1}{\hat \omega - \qq{H_{N-1}^C + \epsilon_q^- \hat n_{q\beta} + H_{imp}}  + \epsilon_q^- - \epsilon_d - U\hat n_{d\ol\beta}}\\
&= \sum_{q\beta}|V_q|^2 \hat n_{q\beta}\rr{1 - \hat n_{d\beta}} \fr{1}{\hat \omega - H^G + \epsilon_q^- - \epsilon_d - U\hat n_{d\ol\beta}}\\
\eeq
Doing similar simplifications as in the previous section (\il{\hat \omega - H^G = \omega, \hat n_{q\beta} = 1}) gives
\beq
\Delta^- \ham_N	&= \sum_{q\beta}|V_q|^2 \rr{1 - \hat n_{d\beta}} \fr{1}{\omega + \epsilon_q^- - \epsilon_d - U\hat n_{d\ol\beta}}\\
		&= \sum_{q\beta}|V_q|^2 \rr{1 - \hat n_{d\beta}} \qq{\hat n_{d\ol\beta}\rr{\fr{1}{\omega + \epsilon^-_q - \epsilon_d  - U } - \fr{1}{\omega + \epsilon^-_q - \epsilon_d}} + \fr{1}{\omega + \epsilon^-_q - \epsilon_d}}\\
		&= \sum_{\beta} \hat n_{d\beta}\sum_q |V_q|^2\rr{\fr{1}{\omega + \epsilon^-_q - \epsilon_d  - U } - \fr{2}{\omega + \epsilon^-_q - \epsilon_d}} \\
		&+ \sum_{\beta}\hat n_{d\beta}\hat n_{d\ol\beta}\sum_q 2|V_q|^2\rr{\fr{1}{\omega + \epsilon^-_q - \epsilon_d} - \fr{1}{\omega + \epsilon^-_q - \epsilon_d  - U }}\\
\eeq
We get the following scaling equations for the hole sector:
\beq
\Delta^- \epsilon_d &= \sum_q |V_q|^2\rr{\fr{1}{\omega + \epsilon^-_q - \epsilon_d  - U } - \fr{2}{\omega + \epsilon^-_q - \epsilon_d}}\\
\Delta^- U &= \sum_q 2|V_q|^2\rr{\fr{1}{\omega + \epsilon^-_q - \epsilon_d} - \fr{1}{\omega + \epsilon^-_q - \epsilon_d  - U }}
\eeq
\subsubsection*{Scaling equations}
Combining the two sectors, the scaling equations become
\beq
\Delta \epsilon_d &= \sum_q |V_q|^2\rr{\fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d} + \fr{1}{\omega + \epsilon^-_q - \epsilon_d  - U } - \fr{2}{\omega + \epsilon^-_q - \epsilon_d}}\\
\Delta U &= \sum_q 2|V_q|^2\rr{\fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d + U } - \fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d} + \fr{1}{\omega + \epsilon^-_q - \epsilon_d} - \fr{1}{\omega + \epsilon^-_q - \epsilon_d  - U }}
\eeq
\subsubsection*{Particle-hole symmetric case}
For \il{U = -2\epsilon_d} (and setting \il{\epsilon_q^+ = -\epsilon_q^-}), the equations become
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
\Delta \epsilon_d &= \sum_q |V_q|^2\rr{\fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d} + \fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d} - \fr{2}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ - \epsilon_d}}\\
&= \sum_q |V_q|^2\rr{\fr{2}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d} - \fr{2}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ - \epsilon_d}}\\
\hf\Delta U &= \sum_q |V_q|^2\rr{\fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ - \epsilon_d} - \fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d} + \fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ - \epsilon_d} - \fr{1}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d}}\\
&= \sum_q |V_q|^2\rr{\fr{2}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ - \epsilon_d} - \fr{2}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d}}\\
\implies \Delta\epsilon_d + \hf \Delta U &= 0
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
\textit{The particle-hole symmetry is maintained for all \il{\omega}.}
\subsubsection*{Matching poor man's scaling}
\textit{Assuming a spherical shell (\il{\epsilon_q^+ = D,\epsilon_q^- = -D}) and momentum-independent scattering\\ (\il{\sum_q |V_q|^2 = |V|^2 \rho |\delta D| = |\delta D|\fr{\Delta}{\pi}}) and setting \il{\omega = 0}},
\beq
\delta \epsilon_d &= |\delta D|\fr{\Delta}{\pi}\rr{\fr{1}{ - D + \epsilon_d} + \fr{1}{ - D - \epsilon_d  - U } - \fr{2}{ - D - \epsilon_d}}\\
&= |\delta D|\fr{\Delta}{\pi}\rr{\fr{2}{D + \epsilon_d} - \fr{1}{ D - \epsilon_d} - \fr{1}{D + \epsilon_d + U }}\\
\delta U &= |\delta D|\fr{2\Delta}{\pi}\rr{\fr{1}{ - D + \epsilon_d  + U } - \fr{1}{ - D + \epsilon_d} + \fr{1}{ - D - \epsilon_d} - \fr{1}{ - D - \epsilon_d  - U }}\\
&= |\delta D|\fr{2\Delta}{\pi}\rr{\fr{1}{D - \epsilon_d} - \fr{1}{D - \epsilon_d - U } - \fr{1}{D + \epsilon_d} + \fr{1}{D + \epsilon_d + U}}\\
\eeq
These are identical to equation set 3.61 in Hewson.%TODO cite \footnote{HEWSON, A. C., 1993, The Kondo Problem to Heavy Fermions (Cambridge University Press)}

\subsection*{With higher order scattering}
\beq
\ham = \sum_{k\sigma}\epsilon_k \hat n_{k\sigma} + \sum_{k\sigma} \rr{V_{k} c^\dagger_{k\sigma} c_{d\sigma} + h.c.} + \epsilon_{d}\sum_\sigma  \hat n_{d\sigma} +  U \hat n_{d\ua} \hat n_{d\da} + \sum_{kk^\prime\atop{\sigma\sigma^\prime}}V_2c^\dagger_{d\sigma^\prime}c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c_{d\sigma}c_{k^\prime\sigma^\prime}
\eeq
Such an interaction allows both spin-flip (\il{d\sigma \to d\ol\sigma}) as well as spin-preserving (\il{d\sigma \to d\sigma}) scattering.
\beq
\ham_N = H_{N-1} + H_\text{imp} + \rr{\epsilon_q  + V_2 \hat n_{d\beta}}\hat n_{q\beta} + V_q c^\dagger_{q\beta}c_{d\beta} + \text{h.c.}  \\
+\sum_{k\sigma}V_2\rr{c^\dagger_{q\beta}c^\dagger_{d\sigma}c_{k\sigma}c_{d\beta} + c^\dagger_{d\beta}c^\dagger_{k\sigma}c_{d\sigma}c_{q\beta}}
\eeq
\paragraph{Particle sector:}
The intermediate state consists of particle states, obtained by exciting electrons to the upper bandwidth edge (\il{+D}).
\beq
\Delta^+ \ham_N = \sum_{q\beta}c^\dagger_{d\beta}\qq{V^*_q + \sum_{k^\prime\sigma^\prime} V_2 c^\dagger_{k^\prime\sigma^\prime}c_{d\sigma^\prime}}c_{q\beta}\fr{1}{\hat \omega - \rr{H_{N-1}^C + H_\text{imp} + V_2 \hat n_{d\beta} + \epsilon_q}\hat n_{q\beta}}\\
c^\dagger_{q\beta}\qq{V_q + \sum_{k\sigma}V_2 c^\dagger_{d\sigma}c_{k\sigma}}c_{d\beta}
\eeq
Since the Greens function is preceded by \il{c^\dagger_{q\beta}}, we can substitute \il{\hat n_{q\beta}=1} in the denominator.
\beq
\fr{1}{\hat \omega - \rr{H_\text{imp} + V_2 \hat n_{d\beta} + \epsilon_q}\hat n_{q\beta}}c^\dagger_{q\beta} &= \fr{1}{\hat \omega - \rr{H_{N-1}^C + H_\text{imp} + V_2 \hat n_{d\beta} + \epsilon^+_q}}c_{q\beta}^\dagger\\
\eeq
\beq
\Delta^+ \ham_N = \sum_{q\beta}c_{q\beta}c^\dagger_{d\beta}\qq{V^*_q + \sum_{k^\prime\sigma^\prime} V_2 c^\dagger_{k^\prime\sigma^\prime}c_{d\sigma^\prime}}\fr{1}{\omega - H_{N-1}^C - H_\text{imp} - V_2 \hat n_{d\beta} - \epsilon_q^+}\\
\times \qq{V_q + \sum_{k\sigma}V_2 c^\dagger_{d\sigma}c_{k\sigma}}c_{d\beta}c^\dagger_{q\beta}
\eeq
There are four scattering processes. The changes will be labeled as \il{\Delta^+_i \ham_N}.
\paragraph{1.}
This was calculated in the previous section. The only addition is the splitting of the hybridisation coupling:
\beq
|V_q|^2 &= \qq{V_q^1\hat n_{d\ol\beta} + V_q^0\rr{1 - \hat n_{d\ol\beta}}}\times  \qq{\rr{V_q^1}^*\hat n_{d\ol\beta} + \rr{V_q^0}^*\rr{1 - \hat n_{d\ol\beta}}}\\
&=|V_q^1|^2\hat n_{d\ol\beta} + |V_q^0|^2\rr{1 - \hat n_{d\ol\beta}}\\
&=\rr{|V_q^1|^2 - |V_q^0|^2}\hat n_{d\ol\beta} + |V_q^0|^2
\eeq
From eq.~\ref{change},
\beq
\Delta_1^+ \ham &= \sum_{q\beta}\hat n_{d\beta}|V_q|^2\qq{\fr{\hat n_{d\ol\beta}}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d  + U } + \fr{1 - \hat n_{d\ol\beta}}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d}} \\
&= \sum_{q\beta}\hat n_{d\beta}\qq{\fr{|V_q^1|^2\hat n_{d\ol\beta}}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d  + U } + \fr{|V_q^0|^2\rr{1 - \hat n_{d\ol\beta}}}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d}}\\
&= \sum_{q\beta}\hat n_{d\beta}\fr{|V_q^0|^2}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d} + 2\sum_{q}\hat n_{d\ua}\hat n_{d\da}\qq{\fr{|V_q^1|^2}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d  + U } - \fr{|V_q^0|^2}{\omega - \epsilon_q^+ + \epsilon_d}}\\
\eeq
\paragraph{2.}
\beq
\Delta_2^+\ham_N &=\sum_{q\beta k\sigma} c_{q\beta}c^\dagger_{d\beta}\fr{V_q^* V_2}{\hat \omega - H_{N-1}^C - H_\text{imp} - V_2 \hat n_{d\beta} - \epsilon_q^+}c^\dagger_{d\sigma}c_{k\sigma}c_{d\beta}c^\dagger_{q\beta}\\
		 &=\sum_{q \beta k} c_{q\beta}c^\dagger_{d\beta}\fr{V_q^* V_2}{\hat \omega - H_{N-1}^C - H_\text{imp} - V_2 \hat n_{d\beta} - \epsilon_q^+}c^\dagger_{d\ol\beta}c_{k\ol\beta}c_{d\beta}c^\dagger_{q\beta} &&\qq{c^\dagger_\beta c^\dagger_\sigma = \delta_{\beta\sigma}c^\dagger_\beta}\\
		 &=\sum_{q \beta k}c_{q\beta}c^\dagger_{d\beta}\fr{V_q^* V_2 }{\hat \omega - H_{N-1}^C - \epsilon_d \hat n_{d\ol\beta} - \epsilon_q^+}c^\dagger_{d\ol\beta}c_{k\ol\beta}c_{d\beta}c^\dagger_{q\beta} &&\qq{\hat n_{d\beta} = 0\text{ in propagator}}\\
\eeq
We cannot directly push the propagator to the end, because it still has an \il{\hat n_{d\ol\beta}}. We can use an identity. If \il{A} and \il{B} are two entities that commute with \il{c^\dagger_{d\ol\beta}}, then
\begin{gather*}
\rr{A - B\hat n_{d\ol\beta}}c^\dagger_{d\ol\beta} = Ac^\dagger_{d\ol\beta} - Bc^\dagger_{d\ol\beta}\rr{1 - \hat n_{d\ol\beta}} = c^\dagger_{d\ol\beta}\rr{A - B + B\hat n_{d\ol\beta}}\\
\implies \fr{1}{A - B\hat n_{d\ol\beta}}c^\dagger_{d\ol\beta} = c^\dagger_{d\ol\beta} \fr{1}{A - B + B\hat n_{d\ol\beta}}
\end{gather*}
This gives
\beq
\fr{1}{\hat \omega - H_{N-1}^C - \epsilon_d \hat n_{d\ol\beta} - \epsilon_q^+}c^\dagger_{d\ol\beta} = c^\dagger_{d\ol\beta} \fr{1}{\hat \omega - H_{N-1}^C - \epsilon_d + \epsilon_d\hat n_{d\ol\beta} - \epsilon_q^+}\\
\eeq
A similar process gives
\beq
\fr{1}{\hat \omega - H_{N-1}^{C,\rr{k\ol\beta}} - \epsilon_k \hat n_{k\ol\beta} - \epsilon_d + \epsilon_d\hat n_{d\ol\beta} - \epsilon_q^+}c_{k\ol\beta} &= c_{k\ol\beta} \fr{1}{\hat \omega - H_{N-1}^{C,\rr{k\ol\beta}} - \epsilon_d + \epsilon_d\hat n_{d\ol\beta} - \epsilon_q^+}\\
																			 &= c_{k\ol\beta} \fr{1}{\hat \omega - H_{N-1}^{C} + \epsilon_k \hat n_{k\ol\beta} - \epsilon_d + \epsilon_d\hat n_{d\ol\beta} - \epsilon_q^+}\\
																			 &= c_{k\ol\beta} \fr{1}{\hat \omega - H_{N-1}^{C} + \epsilon_k^- - \epsilon_d + \epsilon_d\hat n_{d\ol\beta} - \epsilon_q^+}\\
\eeq
(\il{H_{N-1}^{C,\rr{k\sigma}} = H_{N-1}^C - \epsilon_k \hat n_{k\sigma}}). The change in \il{\ham} becomes
\beq
&\sum_{q \beta k}V_q^* V_2 \rr{1 - \hat n_{q\beta}}\hat n_{d\beta}c^\dagger_{d\ol\beta}c_{k\ol\beta} \fr{1}{\hat \omega - H_{N-1}^C + \epsilon_k^- - \epsilon_d + \epsilon_d\hat n_{d\ol\beta} - \epsilon_q^+}
\eeq
Since this term must act on a state with \il{\hat n_{d\beta} = 1 - \hat n_{d\ol\beta} = 1}, we can write
\beq
\hat \omega - H_{N-1}^C - \epsilon_d + \epsilon_d\hat n_{d\ol\beta} - \epsilon_q^+ &= \hat \omega - H_{N-1}^C - \epsilon_d\hat n_{d\beta} - \epsilon_d\hat n_{d\ol\beta} - U \hat n_{d\beta}\hat n_{d\ol\beta}- \epsilon_q^+\\
										   &= \hat \omega - H^G - \epsilon_q^+\\
										   &= \omega - \epsilon_q^+
\eeq
Therefore,
\beq
